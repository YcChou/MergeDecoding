"On Monday, the Israeli army withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Palestinians rejoiced over this occasion, with Mahmoud Abb","as, the Palestinian president, declaring that the withdrawal was a ""victory for the Palestinian people.""
But the Palestinians' celebrations were short-lived. On Tuesday, the Israeli army re-entered the Gaza Strip, killing at least 19 Palestinians and wounding more than 100.
The Israeli army said it had entered the Gaza Strip to destroy tunnels used by Palestinian militants to smuggle weapons into the territory.
The Israeli army said it had entered the Gaza Strip","as saying that ""This is a day of happiness and joy that the Palestinian people have not witnessed for a century.""

The 38 years of Israeli presence in the Gaza strip have officially ended.

Palestinians were overjoyed at the sight of the burning synagogues, planting flags in the midst of it all, and shouting cries of independence. Teenagers set fire to a few synagogues, letting out anger at Israel's occupation.

The fires did little damage to the concrete structures, but Abbas said that the Palestinians planned to destroy them fully.

Palestinian police admitted that there was not much they could or would do to stop this.

Last year, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy the synagogues, but this Sunday, under pressure from religious Jewish organizations, it reversed its decision. Palestinians were angry at the cabinet's Sunday vote.

The synagogues, as well as all community structures, including community centers, schools, and sports facilites, are the only physical remnants of the Israeli Gaza Strip presence since all residential structures have been destroyed."

The announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days. The dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players. The majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount. The club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million. Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said ""The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.""

This will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded. That year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off."

Nation of Islam and Arab nation: Rejoice for it is time to take revenge against the British Zionist Crusader government in retaliation for the massacres Britain is committing in Iraq and Afghanistan. The heroic mujahideen have carried out a blessed raid in London. Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters.

We have repeatedly warned the British Government and people. We have fulfilled our promise and carried out our blessed military raid in Britain after our mujahideen exerted strenuous efforts over a long period of time to ensure the success of the raid.

We continue to warn the governments of Denmark and Italy and all the Crusader governments that they will be punished in the same way if they do not withdraw their troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. He who warns is excused.

God says: ""You who believe: If ye will aid (the cause of) Allah, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly.

The statement was published on Qal3ah, an internet forum which has been used before for announcements by Al-Qaeda, though the validity of the claims are currently unconfirmed. At a press conference, the Metropolitan Police stated they had not received any claims of responsibility from any group."
Molson Canada picks up Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. as the company maneuvers to make an entry into the craft beer,"market.
Molson Canada, a subsidiary of Molson Coors Brewing Company, has acquired Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. for an undisclosed amount.
The acquisition is part of Molson Canada’s strategy to enter the craft beer market.
Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. is a small brewery located in the village of Creemore, Ontario. The company was founded in 1987 by J.P. McConnell and his wife, Deborah.
The company produces a variety of beers, including the","market.

Creemore Springs of Creemore, Ontario, produces the locally popular Creemore Springs lager. The merger will allow the company to retain its identity.

""The Creemore brand image and brewing craft will remain unchanged,"" Creemore Springs Brewery chairman Bill Wilder said. ""Molson understands and appreciates what is special about the Creemore brand and this makes them a great purchaser for the company.""

Industry observers are mixed on the benefits of the deal for Molson. The CBC reports one analyst suggests Molson may be trying to replicate the success of rival Labatt's premium beers. Others point out the small brewery model does not scale up well, and the attraction of a ""boutique"" beer fades in large-scale production.

Molson Coors Brewing Co., formed by the US$3.4 billion merger in February of two family-run companies, Canadian Molson and U.S. Coors brewing companies, is the fifth largest brewer in the world by volume. ( TSX:TAP.NV, NYSE:TAP)"
The World Health Organisation has announced that the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatments (ART) in developing countries is increasing significantly - more,"than 10 million people are now receiving ART.
The WHO says that the number of people receiving ART has increased by 1.3 million in the last year alone.
The WHO says that the increase in the number of people receiving ART is due to the fact that more people are being diagnosed with HIV and more people are being treated.
The WHO says that the number of people receiving ART in developing countries is increasing significantly - more than 10 million people are now receiving ART.
The WHO says that the number of people receiving ART has increased by 1","than doubling between December 2003 and June 2005. One million people are now getting the drugs they need, compared to just 400,000 eighteen months ago.

However, access to treatment is not growing as fast as demand, and the UN is unlikely to reach its target of treating three million people by the end of 2005 - just over half the people who need it. The longer-term target of universal treatment by 2010 is still likely to be met.

The figures show that the number of people receiving ART is increasing in every part of the globe, but not as quickly as people are contracting HIV. The numbers getting treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, the part of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS has increased threefold on a year ago, and doubled in the last six months. The same rate of growth as also been seen in Asia, the second-worst affected area.

The WHO's report highlights that the best progress has been made when governments have worked together with the WHO, the UN and other parterners. The report goes on to make recommendations for simplifying the process to enable treatment levels to be increased even faster.

The UN's target was based on what was hypothetically possible if all possible steps to provide treatment were taken. The report shows the while financial, political and technical steps have been made, other areas are falling short.

Pressure groups said that countries were reacting too slowly to the pandemic and called on the G8 to provide more sustainable funding for universal treatment for Aids.

UK international development minister Gareth Thompson said: ""We are committed to universal access to HIV treatments by 2010. We will spend £1.5bn in the next three years on Aids, including £150m on orphans."""
A recent survey conducted by the American Cancer Society has turned up some surprising results: Americans generally hold false beliefs about the nature of cancer and its treatment,".
The survey, which was conducted in 2012, asked 1,000 adults about their beliefs about cancer. The results showed that many people believe that cancer is contagious, that cancer is a death sentence, and that cancer is a result of bad luck.
The survey also found that many people believe that cancer is a result of bad luck, and that there is nothing that can be done to prevent it.
The survey also found that many people believe that cancer is a result of bad luck, and that there is nothing that can be done to prevent it. In fact,",", even though many believe they are well informed.

Health experts say this ignorance could be dangerous: People may be making poor health decisions -- avoiding cancer screenings or rejecting potentially life-saving treatments -- based on their incorrect notions.

The most common misconception is that surgery causes cancer to spread. Decades ago, cancer often was not discovered until it was very advanced. At that stage, surgical efforts were rarely successful, and many patients died soon after procedures were performed. This may have given rise to the mistaken belief that the surgeries caused the disease to worsen.

Another commonly held myth is that there is a cure for cancer, but the medical industry is withholding it in order to continue profiting from the sale of less effective treatments and medications.

Believers in this ""conspiracy theory"" may not be guided by it in making their personal health decisions, though. The American Cancer Society says that even though many people are suspicious of the medical industry in general, they have a trusting relationship with their own physicians and are likely to follow their advice.

Almost 20 percent of the people surveyed felt that medications for cancer pain were ineffective.

About 10 percent expressed the belief that cancer could be cured with a positive attitude alone, while a similar number felt that there was no effective treatment for cancer.

The fact is, cancer survival and treatments -- including pain management -- have vastly improved in the last thirty years.

Results of the survey appear in the August 1 issue of Cancer, a journal published by the American Cancer Society."

Brazil is threatening to break the patent of US-based Abbott Laboratories as it pushes ahead with its programme to supply its people with,"cheap generic drugs.
The country’s health ministry has said it will not renew the patent for the antiretroviral drug Kaletra, which is used to treat HIV/Aids.
The move is part of a wider programme to provide cheaper drugs to the country’s poor.
Abbott said it was “disappointed” by the decision.
“We are disappointed that the Brazilian government has decided to not renew the patent for Kaletra,” said Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel.
“We are committed to working with","free AIDS drugs.

Brazil has given Abbott a deadline of July 7 to cut the prices of its drug Kaletra or a Brazilian company will begin cloning it. This move would test recent World Trade Organization concessions allowing poor countries to produce generic drugs for local health emergencies.

Abbott has said that Brazil's demand goes ""against the spirit"" of the WTO agreement, since it has the ninth largest economy in the world, and that this could damage future research for improved treatments.

Previous programmes have been negotiated between companies and governments to produce generic versions of AIDS drugs, but this is the first time a country has threatened to use powers negotiated at the WTO by producing the drug without the cooperation of the patent holder.

Several campaign groups are supporting the move, hoping that other developing countries will be able to take the lead of Brazil and produce generic drugs for their own populations. Michael Bailey, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam International, said: ""The impact of breaking the patent would be enormous. If a major country such as Brazil goes through with this, not only will it help ensure sustainability of their excellent treatment programme, it will set a hugely important precedent for other countries.""

The US Chamber of Commerce has issued a statement urging Brazil to reconsider and suggesting that the move could create a rift between the countries. Thomas Donohue, Chamber President and CEO said: ""Brazil’s threat to strip patent rights from a U.S. company should concern all investors and every business around the world because of the precedent it sets for the treatment of intellectual property."""
Millions of origami cranes have been dropped on Thailand's three southern provinces following violence between the government and ethnic minority Muslim populations,".

Up to 120 million such paper sculptures were dropped on Thailand's three southern-most provinces, Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. Tensions in this area have increased recently, peaking with the recent death of 85 demonstrators arrested during a protest. The government blamed their deaths on physical weakness due to fasting in the month of Ramadan as the cause, as most if not all the deaths occurred during transport of up to 500 arrested protestors. Critics of the Thai government have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, blaming the ""over-eagerness"" of Thai security forces as the cause of the deaths.

The dispersal was timed to coincide with the birthday of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and has generated much interest from the rest of the country's predominantly Buddhist population.
The cranes were built by citizens throughout Thailand and had peace messages written on them. The southern, Muslim provinces are often considered neglected by a north that is larger and of the majority ethnic group. Some have welcomed the goodwill gesture, but critics in both the north and south have said that the resources would have been better spent solving the problems in the south. Some Islamic leaders in the south have also expressed concerns that the gesture may not be properly understood by Muslims, as the crane carries no cultural significance with them."
"In the wake of a United States Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. New London on eminent domain last week, a California man has proposed","a new law that would allow property owners to take the property of others.
The law, proposed by California resident and attorney Richard Rider, would allow property owners to take the property of others if they can prove that the property is being used for a purpose that is not in the best interest of the community.
""The Supreme Court has ruled that the government can take your property for the benefit of another private party,"" Rider said. ""I think it's only fair that the people should have the same right.""
Rider said that the law would be a ""check and balance"" to the Supreme Court","that Justice David Souter's New Hampshire home be seized by the state and a hotel be built on the site. Logan Darrow Clements faxed a letter to town officials in Weare, New Hampshire June 28, 2005 that justified the action as such:

""The justification for such an eminent domain action is that our hotel will better serve the public interest as it will bring in economic development and higher tax revenue to Weare.""

Justice Souter, who was in the majority ruling in the Kelo case, has lived at the farmhouse in Weare since he was 11 years old. Clements indicated that it was necessary to build on that location because ""it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans."" The action has given rise to a great deal of support nationwide, as many are writing to the councilors of the small town of Weare to voice their approval for the proposal.

The proposal for the ""Lost Liberty Hotel"", as it is to be called, features a number of components which seem to focus on the libertarian leanings of its designer. A dining room, called the ""Just Desserts Cafe"" and a museum based on the ""loss of freedom in America"" are two such components. Instead of a Bible provided by the Gideons (a standard item placed in most American hotel rooms), each guest will receive a free copy of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged."

The question put to voters will be:

:Bent U voor of tegen instemming door Nederland met het verdrag tot vaststelling van een grondwet voor Europa?
:""Are you for or against approval by the Netherlands of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe?""

All the main political parties have asked for a voor (for, or yes) vote. However polls have been saying that two-thirds of the people will be voting tegen (against, or no).

One reason for people to vote no is the expansion of the European Union with large countries like Turkey, which they fear will cause less influence for the smaller countries. The view of an European super state in which the Netherlands would loose its own identity is another reason for voting no. Some of the no voters do this to show they don't agree with the current political situation and the supposed risen prices since the introduction of the euro.

This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's Oil-for-Food program with Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali although there is no charge against him in the report.

In an interview with Voice of America reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie said: ""In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later.... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program.""

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.

After being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said: ""Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him.""

On Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: ""We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it."""
"Bitmover, the company producing a management program for computer source code named Bitkeeper (BK), announced on April 5 that it will no longer","offer its software for free.
Bitkeeper is a revision control system that allows developers to track changes to source code and to merge changes from different developers. It is used by many open source projects, including the Linux kernel.
Bitkeeper is a proprietary program, but Bitmover has offered a free version of the software to open source developers. The free version has been available since 2001.
The free version of Bitkeeper will continue to be available, but Bitmover will no longer offer support for the free version.
""We will continue to offer the free version of Bitkeeper, but we will","be providing a free version of its product.

As a result of Bitmover's announcement, the programmer who wrote the original Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds, stated on a mailing list that he ""decided to not use BK mainly because he needs to figure out the alternatives"". As to an alternative to Bitkeeper, Torvalds hinted that he is considering Monotone but that Subversion, a recent replacement for CVS, is out of the running. Bitkeeper was originally developed to allow Torvalds to manage code contributions more easily, according to Jeremy Andrews at Kerneltrap.org, and was previously provided to kernel developers free of charge, though it was restricted in its use.

Bitkeeper is the software that Torvalds and hundreds of other Linux developers use to manage submissions of code to the Linux kernel, the heart of the computer operating systems referred to as ""Linux"" or ""GNU/Linux"". Linux is distributed in many different forms, bundled with other software by companies such as Red Hat, Novell, and Linspire.

While the details are not clear, it appears from Andrews' article that Bitmover's decision to stop releasing the free version of Bitkeeper is related to a dispute with Torvalds' employer, Open Source Development Labs (OSDL).

According to Kerneltrap, an OSDL contractor had been reverse engineering the free version of Bitkeeper in order to make an open source replacement, which is prohibited by the license under which the free version of Bitkeeper is released. Nevertheless, Torvalds notes in his post that he is ""personally very happy with BK, and with Larry McVoy, the CEO of Bitmover."""

The aircraft maintenance program started in the 1970s and was suspended in the late 1990s when the former workers started to show signs of medical problems ranging from memory loss to neurological problems.

The third Test ended in a draw (with England one wicket away from a win), and England narrowly won the fourth Test in Nottingham by three wickets after the English enforced follow on after a poor first innings by Australia.

The fifth and final Test started on 8 September at the Oval in London. It entered its final day evenly balanced with all results still possible and the destination of the urn still in doubt. Australia needed to win to force a 2-2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give them to England, ending 18 years and eight series of Australian dominance. In the end, England managed to bat out the final day, and a draw ensured the Ashes were coming back to England.

Kevin Pietersen and Ashley Giles hit personal bests of 158 and 59 respectively, to bat out the best part of the last day. Pieterson's 158 was his maiden test century, and included 7 sixes. Early in the day, Australia looked to be in with a chance of winning the match, with early wickets leaving England at 67 for 3. Giles and Pietersen's century partnership, though, left Australia with no hope of catching England in the remains of the day, sealing England's Ashes win since 1987.

England's next Tests will be an away series in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the world champions Australia will play an ICC World XI (which inclues Kevin Pietersen, Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff) in the Johnnie Walker Super Series in early October."
Space.com reported yesterday on a picture of a planet taken by the Very Large Telescope located in Chile. The European Southern Observatory's,"Very Large Telescope (VLT) has captured the first-ever image of a planet outside our solar system passing in front of its parent star. The planet, called Fomalhaut b, orbits the bright southern star Fomalhaut, located 25 light-years away in the constellation Piscis Australis (the ""Southern Fish"").
The planet was first spotted in 2008 by the Hubble Space Telescope, but the new VLT image is the first to show the planet in silhouette as it passes in front of its","telescope, which was used to capture the picture, has made the first confirmed discovery of a planet orbiting another star.

Scientists have been trying to locate planets outside our own solar system for nearly 10 years. Inferences of nearly 150 planets in other solar systems have been observed so far by using instruments and measurements that only suggest the existence of another planet. Until now, no planet has been confirmed by the means of a photographed image. There was, months earlier, another team of scientists who took pictures of what might be another planet, but that image remains controversial because it shows what may be an even more distant object instead.

The research team that photographed the planet with its host star was led by Ralph Neuhaeuser of the Astrophysical Institute &amp; University Observatory (AIU). ""The detection of the faint object near the bright star is certain,"" he told Space.com on Friday.

The new image contains the star, GQ Lupi, with an orbiting planet. It is smaller than our sun, 70% the size, and is located 400 light-years away from our solar system. The planet is nearly twice the size of Jupiter. Unlike our sun which is 4.6 billion years old, the GQ Lupi star is approximately 1 million years old and is considered very young for a star. The planet orbiting GQ Lupi is three times further out than Neptune's orbit around our sun, and scientists estimate the orbiting period to be about 1,200 years. The planets wide orbiting distance from the GQ Lupi was an important element for enabling the photograph to be taken.

The planet, much like the star it orbits, is very hot &amp;mdash; about 2,000 degrees Kelvin &amp;mdash; so despite the detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, which at that temperature would make it gaseous, there is no expectation it might support life.

The discovery will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics."
"Young Quakers who planned to take part in the World Gathering of Young Friends at Lancaster University, England have been unable to attend after having","their visas refused.
The group of 10 young people from the Friends Meeting in Ramallah, Palestine, had been planning to travel to the UK for the event, which takes place from 28 July to 3 August.
The group had been granted visas to travel to the UK in June, but when they arrived at the airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, they were told that their visas had been cancelled.
The group had been planning to travel to the UK for the event, which takes place from 28 July to 3 August.
The group had","their visas denied.

Their absence has been a cause of ""hurt"" at the meetings. Sara Wolcott of Pacific Yearly Meeting on the Western coast of America wrote in a journal on the WGYF website: ""I saw in a workshop for Friends planning to meet in Kenya how much the absence of so many Friends was felt; the gathering felt incomplete. We desperately wanted our brothers and sisters to be with us, I know they wanted to be here too.""

Most of the denials were for economic reasons, if someone doesn't have a high enough income or a fixed job it can be assumed that they will stay in the country for work. Representatives from the gathering now plan to go to Kenya in October to share some of the programme with those who were unable to come.

Despite the missing Friends, the gathering has brought together a mix of different Quaker traditions in a positive atmosphere that has been appreciated by participants. Many Quakers worship in silence (unprogrammed meetings) while others, particularly in America and Africa, have ministers like other churches. Quakers also have differences of opinion over theological issues, including even the existence of God, but the young Friends have not found this to be an obstacle to coming together. Unlike many traditional Christian sects, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, encourage each member to explore his or her own relationship with God.

Chrissy Muhr of Northwest Yearly Meeting (Northwest US) wrote: ""I've been really impressed by how the mix of worship styles has been handled. Almost all the programmed Friends I've spoken to have some prior experience of unprogrammed worship. For me, the hardest thing has been not falling asleep during long periods of silence - the long week has begun to take its toll."""
A new redesigned US $10 bill was introduced at a ceremony yesterday on Ellis Island. The new bill adds three new background colors; red,", orange and yellow. The new bill also features a new portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury.
The new bill will be released into circulation in 2020.
The new $10 bill will be the first US currency note to feature a woman. The new bill will feature a portrait of the first woman to be featured on US currency, suffragist and abolitionist leader, Harriet Tubman.
The new $10 bill will also feature a new security feature, a 3D security ribbon. The new security feature will be visible from both",", yellow and orange. It continues to feature Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. The $10 bill is the third US bill to switch from the traditional green. The $20 and $50 bills were redesigned to feature color within the past two years.

The improvements in digital technology have made it much easier for counterfeiters. ""Ten years ago, 1 percent of (counterfeit) bills were produced on digital equipment. These days, 56 percent are produced on digital equipment, and the technology is more accessible to the general population,"" said Eric Zahren, spokesman for the Secret Service.

According to the Treasury Department, to be able to keep ahead of counterfeiters currency will need to continue to be updated every seven to ten years. The $10 bill was last redesigned in 2000. ""The intention was not to create a counterfeit-proof note&amp;mdash;which is basically impossible&amp;mdash;but one that's harder to duplicate and easier to authenticate,"" said Zahren. This new bill includes many new and enhanced security features such as color-shifting ink, a watermark, microprinting and a security thread

Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said in a statement ""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. Government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure."" The new $10 bill is expected to go into circulation in early 2006."

The 130th running of the Preakness Stakes was attended by a record crowd of 115,318 people in 2015. The previous record was 111,212 in 2009.
The 130th running of the Preakness Stakes was","the historic Pimlico Downs. Favorite Afleet Alex evaded near disaster to win the $1,000,000 graded stakes and the second leg of the triple crown. The race ended the hopes of long shot Giacomo for the triple crown, which includes the Kentucky Derby, The Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes.

At the top of the home stretch the front-runner Scrappy T bolted to the right in response to a whip change by his Jockey Ramon Dominguez. Afleet Alex was blocked by T's rump and his neck was forced to the left. The horse was forced to its knees but stayed on its feet, rocketing to the inside of Scrappy T to take the win by 4 1/2 lengths going away. Scrappy T held on for second, Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo finished third, and Sun King took fourth.

The winner paid $8.60. He topped a $152.60 exacta ($2), a $872 triple (trifecta) ($2) and a $10,362.30 superfecta ($1)."

"House Democrats called for an investigation into possible voting fraud and irregularities during the 2004 U.S. presidential election, according","to a letter sent to the House Judiciary Committee.
The letter, signed by 100 House Democrats, was sent to the committee's chairman, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
The letter, dated March 1, was sent by Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, who is the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.
""We are writing to request that the House Judiciary Committee investigate the extent of voting irregularities and anomalies","to a Dec. 23 letter from House Representative David Wu (D-OR).

Thousands of Ohio citizens have reported experiencing problems casting their votes due to long lines at polling places, malfunctioning voting machines, inexplicable numbers of votes cast, and disenfranchisement in urban areas.

""The integrity of our democracy is at stake. We need to give the American people confidence that each and every vote will be properly counted and that the democratic electoral process is respected,"" Wu said. ""I also understand concerns about the conflict of interest of having an official in charge of running elections in a key state also heading a presidential campaign. I agree that Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell's dual role calls into question any election decision he made that favored Republicans.""

Other Congressmen including John Conyers (D-MI), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and Robert Wexler (D-FL) voiced similar concerns, and requested an investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), citing specific cases in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, and California.

In December, Conyers, the Ranking Democrat on the House Committee on the Judiciary, issued a series of letters about voting irregularities to the media, campaign officials, and manufacturers of voting equipment. These letters seek to collect and preserve information regarding the conduct of the election.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office previously reported on voting irregularities in eariler presidential elections.

A September 14, 2004 GAO report on the 2000 presidential elections detailed changes the DOJ implemented to try to ensure voter access to polls, and the importance of monitoring election-day activities. The report warned that allegations in the 2000 election lacked sufficient specifics to enable the DOJ to perform and adequate investigation and recommended that more precise information be collected regarding voting for the 2004 presidential election."
"Missing American teen Natalee Holloway, who vanished on the Dutch island of Aruba two weeks ago, is feared to be","dead, her father said on Friday.
""I think she's dead,"" Dave Holloway told CNN. ""I think she's dead. I think she's dead.""
Holloway, 18, was last seen leaving a bar with three young men on May 30.
""I'm not going to give up hope,"" he said. ""I'm going to keep looking for her.""
Holloway said he was not sure what he would do if he found out his daughter was dead.
""I don't know,"" he said. ""I don't","dead today following a suspect's statement earlier this morning. The suspect, who is yet to be named, told police that ""something bad happened"" to the missing teen. Police Commissioner District 1 Gerold Dompig said that the suspect was leading police to a scene, where it is believed a major update to the case is to be found.

Two security guards were taken into police custody early last week: 28-year-old Abraham Jones and 30-year-old Mickey John. Additionally, three teenagers who were believed to be the last people to have seen Halloway are now under custody. Among the three teenagers is 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe, 21-year-old Depak Kalpoe, and 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, a friend of the brothers and son to a Judicial Servant.

Anita van der Sloot, mother of suspect Joran van der Sloot, told American news network CNN that her son stated to her that he was ""innocent"", and even offered to speak to Holloway's family. No announcement from police has yet confirmed the death of Holloway."
"A Romanian student officer on mission in Iraq, Major Robertino Ciobanu, was wounded on Sunday by a bullet fired unintentionally","by a US soldier.

The US soldier who fired the shot was also wounded in the leg.
The incident took place in the town of Baqubah, 60 km north of Baghdad.

Representatives of both the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) signed a peace pledge today in the,"Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
The agreement, which was signed by the Sudanese government and the SPLM, is the first step towards ending the 20-year civil war in southern Sudan.
The agreement was signed by Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Taha and SPLM leader John Garang.
The agreement calls for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Sudan, and the creation of a joint military force to protect the country's borders.
The agreement also calls for the creation of a joint committee to oversee the implementation of the","Kenyan capital Nairobi, under the watchful eye of United Nations ambassadors.

According to the BBC, the document concluded with a memorandum saying that ""prompt completion of the peace process is essential for all the people of Sudan"". The actual peace treaty should, according to the pledge, be signed no later than December 31st 2004. While the pledge focuses mainly on the fights between the rebels in the south and the Khartoum-based government in the north, there is also attention for the ongoing crisis in east Sudan (Darfur).

Several aid agencies have criticized the UN for taking a weak stand against the Sudanese government. The Security Council has already signed two resolutions threatening economic sanctions against Sudan if the government does not disarm its troops in Darfur, but, so the BBC reports, the violence is continuing. The civil war in Darfur was sparked in 2003, when insurgents started attacking government buildings. The Arab government in Khartoum subsequently sent troops to the region, which have been reported to mass-violate human rights of the black Africans living in Darfur."
"In anticipation of a Security Council vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the International Criminal Court, Sudan announced today it would reject","the resolution.
The resolution, which was drafted by the United States, France and Britain, would refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC.
The resolution is expected to be voted on tomorrow.
The United States, France and Britain have been pushing for the resolution since the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in March.
The United States has been pushing for the resolution since the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in March.
The United States has been pushing for the resolution since the","any United Nations resolution that required war crimes suspects to be tried abroad. The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the French delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week.

Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, ""Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese &amp;mdash; whether he is a rebel or government official &amp;mdash; outside the Sudan: we are totally against it."" In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group ""Justice and Equality of Movement,"" said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace.

Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to human rights abuses in Darfur. Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts.

The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias. It has often been suggested that this qualifies as genocide, and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights."

"Last night, CNN's Anderson Cooper played a chilling police audio tape of a 1991 confession made by the accused killer","of 11-year-old Jessica Lunsford.
John Couey, 46, was arrested last week in connection with the girl's disappearance.
The tape, which was played on ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" was recorded by a police officer who was interviewing Couey after he was arrested for molesting a 9-year-old girl.
Couey, who was 36 at the time, told the officer that he had molested the girl and that he had also molested Jessica.
""I'm not going to lie to","of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford. On the tape, John E. Couey is heard admitting to molesting a young girl in her own backyard. For the crime he was subsequently charged, convicted and imprisoned for 2 years.

An accompanying written report by the officer who took the taped confession says; ""Couey admitted that this was not the first child he had ever touched, however, this is the first time he was caught."" The officer continues, ""Couey admitted to molesting his wife's daughter, however, she agreed not to report the incident if he left the house and gave her a divorce, which he did."" CNN was unable to locate Couey's former wife.

The revelation calls into question the way Couey has been dealt with by officials over the years. He spoke on the 1991 tape about how he ""needs help"" and ""wants help"".

Mary Doyle, a Citrus County probation official, said Monday that if they had known Couey was a registered sex offender, they may have been able to keep him away from Jessica Lunsford. Florida Courts do not provide probation workers with criminal backgrounds of their probationers, even in the case of registered sexual offenders like Couey, Doyle said. With that information they might have tried harder to locate him when he failed to report in with probation officials last November. When detectives did finally catch up with him, they learned he had been living across the road from Jessica."

On Sunday's CNN's Late Edition, Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai laid the blame for the explosion of opium production in his country at the feet of the US and Britain.

The failure is theirs, not ours."" Kazai said. ""Where international money and creation of forces for destruction of poppies was concerned, it was ineffective and delayed and half-hearted.""

Karzai was responding to allegations in Sunday's New York Times that his government was dragging their heels in reducing the opium production in Afghanistan. In Kandahar Province last week, farmers were visible from the main road scraping the last resin from poppy plants. That location is just 10 minutes outside the provincial capital."

She became the first known person to recover from the disease without vaccination.

On September 12, 2004, Jeanna &amp;mdash; a 15 year old from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin&amp;mdash; was bitten by a bat while attending church. By the time she saw a doctor about fatigue and numbness, it was October 18, and the bat incident was not brought up until several days later. Usually when there is a possibility of rabies, doctors will vaccinate patients: the vaccine has a chance to act before the symptoms appear. In Jeanna's case it was too late to try to vaccinate, and her doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin devised a new treatment. Jeanna was put into a drug-induced coma for a week, and doctors began an intensive treatment to prop up her nervous system until her natural immunity recovered enough to fight the disease.

By surviving and recovering, Jeanna became the only person known in medicine to overcome rabies without a vaccine. She is not yet fully recovered: the effects of the coma are still apparent, and she has difficulty with movement. Yet the doctors believe that she is getting well much faster than they expected, and feel that Jeanna will be able to return to her high school studies, needing only physical and occupational therapy.

The novel treatment is hailed by doctors as promising, but needs analysis and verification on another human. Jeanna's is the sixth case of human recovery from a rabies infection, but the other five people were vaccinated against rabies either before infection, or before the symptoms appeared."

Mrs Pardoel said she opposes the war. ""I think it's just cold-blooded murder. Look at all those young American boys that have been slaughtered,"" she said. ""I don't think this should have gone on ... He said to me one night he phoned, he said, 'Mum there's nowhere to hide here, it's just so dangerous, there's nowhere to hide'.""

Thirty-five year old Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel had been on his last flight when the C-130 Hercules he was aboard crashed north of Baghdad yesterday, killing ten personnel. He was serving with the British Royal Air Force (RAF), to which he had transferred several years ago from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), as Navigator in 47 Squadron Lyneham RAF.

Mr Pardoel had been expecting to return in July to his wife and three children in Australia, where they had recently bought a new house in Canberra.

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, says he is saddened to hear of the man's death.

""I want his family to know, and his friends to know, that he certainly did not die in vain, that this tragic accident occurred - or this tragedy because it may not have been an accident - but this tragedy occurred on a day when 65 per cent of the people of Iraq went out and voted,"" he said."
"Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found","in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana.
The tissue was found in a 68-million-year-old fossil of a juvenile T. rex, and it was preserved in a way that allowed scientists to identify the tissue as soft bone.
The discovery is the first time that soft bone tissue has been found in a T. rex.
The discovery was made by a team of scientists from the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, and the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers were able","in a sandstone formation in Montana.

MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science.

Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. “Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.”, paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Richard A. Hengst of Purdue University said the finding ""opens the door for research into the protein structure of ancient organisms, if nothing else. While we think that nature is conservative in how things are built, this gives scientists an opportunity to observe this at the chemical and cellular level.""

Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said the discovery was ""pretty exciting stuff."" ""You are actually getting into the small-scale biology of the animal, which is something we rarely get the opportunity to look at."""
"Speaking in Texas, President Bush in a Wednesday address to the American Legislative Exchange Council in the city of Grapevine said, ""","I'm a strong believer in the death penalty as a deterrent to crime.""
The president said he was ""disappointed"" that the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional for juveniles.
""I believe that the death penalty is an effective deterrent to crime,"" Bush said. ""I believe it's a just punishment for those crimes that are most heinous. I believe it's a necessary tool for those who would take the life of a law enforcement officer.""

""After September the 11th, I made a commitment to the American people that the United States of America will not wait to be attacked again."" Bush said. ""We will take the fight to the enemy, and we will defend our freedom.""

There has been debate within the Administration as to how to refer to the ongoing conflict. In recent appearances, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has avoided using the word ""war"", preferring the phrase ""global struggle against violent extremism."" Bush's speech marks a return to the existing phrase ""war on terror"". In the speech he acknowledged that the struggle is against those who use terror to achieve their goals, implicitly recognising that the term ""war on terror"" may be misleading.

""Make no mistake about it, this is a war against people who profess an ideology, and they use terror as a means to achieve their objectives,"" he said.

Of the military strategy in Iraq, Bush said that coalition forces continue to hunt down terrorists, and the Iraqi security forces are being trained to take on more responsibility. ""As Iraqis stand up, Americans and coalition forces will stand down,"" Bush said. ""And we're making progress. More and more Iraqi units are more and more capable of defending themselves.""

The return of American forces to U.S. soil will be event-driven decision, he said. A timetable for withdrawal is not practical because it would give the enemy a tactical event upon which to plan.

Politically, Iraq's National Assembly is working on a constitution that members pledged to have ready by August 15. The Iraqi people would then vote on the constitution October 15. If passed, the new Iraqi government under a constitution would be elected December 15.

"The White House announced the selection of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World Bank, replacing John Wolfensohn who retires as acting president after 1","0 years.
Paul Wolfowitz, 61, is a former deputy secretary of defense and a former ambassador to Indonesia. He is currently a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
The World Bank is a multilateral institution that provides loans to developing countries. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C.
The World Bank is a member of the World Bank Group, which also includes the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA).
The World Bank Group is headquartered in","0 years. The switch is expected to occur sometime in June.

The choice of Wolfowitz is raising controversy in Europe and developing nations. Known as hawkish and outspoken, Wolfowitz was a pro-Iraqi war neo-conservative in his role as deputy Secretary of Defense, and a chief architect in the build up to war with Iraq. Some question whether Wolfowitz, who was criticized for brushing aside European and NATO calls for caution before the Iraq war, would use the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as tool to extend U.S. foreign policy interests.

Historically, it has been the White House’s prerogative to name the candidate because the U.S. holds a majority on the 24 member board, but board members from nations other than the U.S. are seeking their own interviews to qualify the candidate before a change is made. ""The executive directors have agreed to conduct informal meetings over the coming days with the US nominee as part of the consultative process."" the IMF said in a statement. ""Thereafter, the executive directors will meet in a formal session to select the president at which time an official announcement of the outcome will be made,"" it said. The vote is set for March 31, the same day Wolfensohn retires.

Rob Nichols, the US Treasury spokesperson, said Wolfowitz has begun scheduling meetings with board members and that, ""Our nominee… looks forward to meeting with and listening to members of the World Bank board."" Reuters reported. In the meantime, Wolfowitz has worked to assure those with concerns of him, saying he would come with an open mind and no political program."

"United States President George W. Bush's nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security, Bernard Kerik, has declined to continue through Senate confirm","ation hearings.
Kerik, a former New York City police commissioner, withdrew his name from consideration for the post on Thursday, November 9, 2004.
Kerik's nomination was in trouble after it was revealed that he had not paid all of his taxes, and had not disclosed a relationship with a woman who had been convicted of drug trafficking.
Kerik's nomination was also in trouble because of his ties to a company that had been awarded a contract to provide security at the World Trade Center after the September","ation. In a letter to President Bush, Kerik explained that the immigration status of a housekeeper and nanny, as well as nonpayment of income tax on the housekeeper were his reasons for retracting.

However, Kerik's past dealings may have been the strongest reason for his decision to withdraw from the nomination. Newsweek has uncovered that as recently as 1998, a New Jersey judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kerik following a tangled web of lawsuits relating to unpaid bills on a condominum. Newsday and the Seattle Times have reported that Kerik may have business ties to the Mob and allegations of two extramarital affairs have arisen.

In addition, his windfall profit from stock options in Taser International (i.e. ""Taser guns"") with no apparent investment, has been under heavy investigation. Kerik received a profit of more than USD $6 million after selling his stock in early November, just before an Amnesty International report critical of Taser guns was released. Kerik had joined Taser International's board shortly after resigning as New York City's police commissioner; both the NYPD and Department of Homeland Security have purchased large amounts of Taser's non-lethal electroshock weapons."

"Zardad Faryadi Sarwar (also known as Zardad Khan and Commander Zardad), a warlord who controlled several checkpoints","in Kabul, Afghanistan, was killed in a suicide attack on 20 January 2014.

## Biography

Zardad Faryadi Sarwar was born in 1968 in the village of Khalaj in the Qarabagh district of Ghazni Province. He was the son of Faryadi Sarwar, a former mujahideen commander who fought against the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Zardad Faryadi Sarwar was a member of the Jamiat-e Islami party.

In 1","at the road between Kabul and Jalalabad in Afghanistan in the early 1990s, was convicted today of torture and hostage-taking. The Court at Old Bailey in London found that Zardad pursued a reign of fear along his checkpoints and ordered summary executions and torture of innocent civilians. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.

Zardad denied all charges throughout the trials, and claimed he had been set up by enemies in Afghanistan.

""I have never killed anybody and if anybody in the whole of Afghanistan can produce that evidence against me then I will accept that crime,"" he said.

The case is considered to be a landmark in international law. British law allows the prosecution of crimes like torture and hostage-taking in the UK even if no British citizen was involved and the incidents occurred overseas. ""There are some crimes which are so heinous, such an affront to justice, that they can be tried in any country"", Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith said.

Zardad fled to the UK in 1998 after he had fought both the Russians and the Taliban in Afghanistan's long civil war. He settled in a suburban London home and was first confronted by BBC Journalist John Simpson in 2000. Simpson's report sparked a lengthy investigation that would eventually lead to British prosecutors travelling to Afghanistan and questioning Zardad's victims. A first trial began in 2004 but failed because the jury couldn't agree on a verdict."

"An outbreak of cholera in West Africa has resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people, and United Nations (UN)","officials are warning that the number of cases could rise to 200,000 by the end of the year.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the disease could spread to other countries in the region, including Mali, Nigeria, and Senegal.
Ch","health officials are concerned that inadequate health services in the region could result in many more deaths.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that over 31,250 cases of cholera have been reported so far this year in nine West African countries. It has claimed 488 lives at this point. ""If we look at this year's trends, the figures are still going up in many countries,"" said John Mulangu, a senior regional advisor for the WHO. ""If cholera is not brought under control in certain regions, we will soon be talking of... 100,000 cases,"" he said. ""And hospitals and health centres will be overwhelmed. Last year we were not on this scale. The problem is getting worse,"" Mulangu said.

The UN says that the increase could also be related to the fact that due to poverty, many West Africans move around, sometimes out of the country, in order to receive higher wages for their work, and the region has been hit with heavy rains. This helps spread the disease, according to the UN.

""We are about to enter the harvest season where people will be moving around,"" said Herve Ludovic de Lys, the head of OCHA's West Africa office. ""The main goal is to halt the transmission of this disease,"" he said. ""It's not business as usual. This crisis needs a rapid response.""

Oregon State University (OSU) animal researchers in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Dubois,"Experimental Forest in Idaho have discovered that the spread of a deadly fungus that is killing millions of trees in the western United States is being accelerated by climate change.
The researchers found that the fungus, called white pine blister rust, is more likely to infect trees when the weather is warmer and drier. The fungus is spread by wind-blown spores and by the movement of infected trees.
The researchers also found that the fungus is more likely to infect trees when the trees are stressed by drought or other environmental factors.
The researchers",", Idaho-based Sheep Experiment Station released a report on an OSU-USDA study which was initiated in 1995 after breeders asked the government to determine why some rams bought as breeding studs showed no interest in females. The researchers are working under a $2.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in hopes of developing a test which can determine the likelihood of a ram being female-oriented before it is sold as a stud.

By studying difference in the animal's brains after slaughter, the study also showed what could be a biological determiner for what makes a ram male-oriented instead of female-oriented sexually. The scientists' results showed that the anterior preoptic area of the rams' hypothalamus was 50 percent smaller in male-oriented rams as opposed to female oriented rams. A 1991 study of human brains of AIDS victims showed a similar hypothalamus size difference between gay and heterosexual men.

The sheep researchers postulate that low levels of aromatase hormones in the brain of a developing male sheep fetus may have kept the brain from fully masculinizing, leading to sexually male-oriented rams.

""This lends further support to the idea that homosexuality has biological underpinnings,"" Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology, said in an interview with the Corvallis Gazette-Times.

Professor Stormshak believes that ""understanding sexual drives and the continuum of sexual behavior could possibly help explain the scientific basis of sexual assault and put an end to assertions that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."""

Greek Chief Coroner Philippos Koutsaftis stated ""Until now I have done an autopsy on six bodies and first evidence is that when they were killed they had circulation in their heart and lungs.

""That does not mean that they were conscious but that they had breath and circulation. They had circulation and heartbeat so they were alive.""

Initial reports from the Greek Defence Ministry had suggested the bodies were ""frozen solid"" at the moment of impact.

The coroner stressed that as more post mortems were carried out new evidence may come to light.

Nothing is known about the cause of the disaster beyond the fact that everyone on board the airliner was incapacitated at some point, and that emergency oxygen masks had been used. Speculation abounds, with the theory that the airliner failed to maintain pressurisation at some point being the most popular theory.

Helios has said the aircraft was maintained in line with European regulations and had also received a standard inspection before take-off.

Greek police have also arrested a man who claimed his cousin texted him from the airliner, saying the pilots were blue in the face and that they were freezing. He was brought to the district attorney where two charges were filed against him, for lying to the authorities and for spreading false information, and a trial was scheduled. The man claimed that his intention was to gain publicity.

"The final one-day cricket match between Australia and New Zealand has ended with no result after the game was called off due to rain.

The","match was the final of the 2005–06 VB Series, a triangular tournament between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Australia had already won the tournament, and the match was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

The match was reduced to 40 overs per side, and New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat. They were bowled out for 187, with Daniel Vettori top-scoring with 47. Australia were 1 for 12 when the match was called off.

The match was the last one-day international played","lack of a result means that the inaugural Chappell-Hadlee Trophy will not be awarded, as the series was tied at one game each. In the first game, New Zealand scored a thrilling victory from behind to win with two balls to spare, while in the second game, Australia knocked New Zealand over with 17 balls to spare after a valiant fightback attempt by Kyle Mills.

Australia will next meet New Zealand in international cricket in February of 2006, when the Australian team will tour New Zealand and play three one-day internationals.

New Zealand spin bowler Daniel Vettori was proclaimed to be the man of the series, and took away a 42-inch plasma television as a prize."
"The growing power of the Internet is clearly reflected in the decision, announced Tuesday, for the Associated Press to begin charging newspapers and broad","casters for the use of its news stories.
The AP, which has been distributing its stories free to its members for more than 100 years, said it was making the change because of the growing use of its stories by Internet sites.
The AP said it would charge $2.50 for each story used by a Web site, and $12.50 for each story used by a newspaper or broadcaster.
The AP said it would charge $2.50 for each story used by a Web site, and $12.50 for each story used by a newspaper","casters to post wire stories, photos, and other content on their online editions. The changes go into effect January 1, 2006. An advisory committee meeting will be held in the fall to ease the transition.

As the Internet draws more news consumers from traditional repositories of data, increasing numbers are demanding the stories on the Internet reflect the quick updating and coverage of a large wire network such as the Associated Press.

The rates the AP charges, known within as “assessments”, have risen by about 2.75 percent annually during the 90’s. Since the service is supposed to be not-for-profit and is owned by its customers, price increases are a tough sell.

The formula for the new calculations still has not been set, making it difficult to determine how the changes will affect what the outlets charge for their online news coverage. Currently the AP bases rates on newspaper circulation or broadcast audience with the large ones footing the major part of the bill.

The AP is creating a computer database of news paraphernalia which includes stories, photos, graphics, audio and video. It is all designed to make it easier for news rooms to create usable content."

The woman, Schapelle Corby, was arrested at Bali's airport on October 8, 2004, after customs officers found 4.2 kilograms of marijuana in her boogie board bag.
She was sentenced to 20 years in jail on May 27, 2005, after a trial that lasted just 14 days.
The Inquiry will be conducted by the Australian Federal Police and will examine the circumstances surrounding the arrest,","months and allegedly maltreated by the country's own Immigration Department.

The woman, Cornelia Rau, still insisted she was German Anna Schmidt, according to her sister Christine yesterday. ""I think it will take a long time for her to stabilise,"" she said. ""At the moment she doesn't accept that she is Cornelia and she doesn't want to see us.""

""She is still insisting her name is Anna Schmidt and that her passport is in Baxter and that she wants to return to Germany.""

Refugee advocate Pamela Curr claims Ms Rau was held in isolation for 18 to 20 hours a day in Baxter's 'Red One' isolation facility, where she was allegedly kept in simulated daylight for 24 hours a day.

Her family had only discovered her whereabouts through a refugee-initiated effort to identify the woman, authorities having failed to connect the unidentified detainee with her missing person file, held by New South Wales Police since August last year.

After her family recognised media reports of her on Thursday, and contacted the police, her photo was emailed to the Baxter compound and her identity confirmed.

The schizophrenic woman had spent six months in a Queensland prison, according to Channel Nine News, as well as at least two months in immigration detention, according to various sources. Earlier reports had her being handed over to immigration authorities over 10 months ago, with only five days spent in custody with Queensland Police.

Ms Rau is presently recuperating in hospital."

Another former cabinet minister, Clare Short, said: ""She was a very beautiful young woman, she survived ill health and helped bring peace to Northern Ireland and now she's gone far too young.""

Mo Mowlam was central to the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and was popular in Britain for her straightforward approach, informality and honesty.

Ms Mowlam even received a standing ovation during prime minister Blair's speech during the 1998 Labour Party Conference.

Mo Mowlam retired from political life in 2001, but continued to make the headlines by realising her autobiography which was critical of Blair's presidential style of government.

It is thought that the fall that made her go to hospital, and then the hospice where she died, was due to a lack of balance caused by a brain tumour."

However, zoo personnel became suspicious that one fetus was no longer viable after veterinarians failed to detect a heartbeat in one cub last week. Bai Yun failed to give birth to a second cub Tuesday evening. ""It is likely that the second fetus died in utero and was reabsorbed by her body,"" Hall said.

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palesinian President Mahmoud Abbas today declared an end to military and violent activities against each other,".
The two leaders made the announcement at a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, which was attended by the leaders of the United States, the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the Arab League.
The summit was called to discuss the implementation of the road map for peace in the Middle East.
The road map was drawn up by the Quartet of Middle East peace mediators - the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations.
The road map calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state by 2005.
The summit was called",". The two leaders made the expected announcement at a summit held at Shram el-Sheikh, Egypt, the first such meeting between the two sides in four years.

Prime Minister Sharon pledged to end military operations against Palestinians, and President Abbas similarly said that the Palestinians will likewise end ""all acts of violence against Israelis....wherever they are"". Both leaders expressed hope that the agreement will lead to long term peace in the long-running conflict. Prime Minister Sharon said that the agreement is part of the goal of ""quiet, dignified and peaceful lives for all the nations in the Middle East"". President Abbas said ""the calm that is currently prevailing in our territories signals the start of a new era, the start of a hopeful peace."" Both sides also confirmed their intent to create an independent Palestinian state. The talks became possible in the renewed optimism after the death of Yassir Arafat and the election of Abbas.

The agreement marks a profound change in Israeli-Palestinian relations, but the negotiated truce is a shaky peace. The ability of President Abbas to exert control over Palestinian militant groups is questionable, and thorny political issues remain for the Israelis if they begin to withdraw settlers from the occupied territories. There are signs that the Palestinian resistance groups are willing to participate in the cease-fire: the terrorist organisation, HAMAS released a statement in the hours before the summic stating that ""was prepared to calm down resistance raids in the event the Zionist entity reciprocated,"" referring to Sharon's pledge to stop military activities, yet shortly after the summit a spokesman for the organization said it will not be bound by the cease-fire.

","The ruling, which was handed down on 4 September 2004, was a victory for the Palestinians, who had argued that the wall was illegal and that it should be moved to the Green Line. The court ruled that the wall should be moved in 10 places, and that the government should reconsider the route in 15 other places.

The court also ruled that the government should consider the humanitarian needs of the Palestinians, and that the wall should not be built in a way that would cause the Palestinians to suffer.

The court also ruled that","The panel of nine justices gave their ruling on a petition submitted by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and ordered that alternative routes be investigated around the settlement of Alefei Menashe. The court ruling orders that the existing wall in the area be demolished and rebuilt nearer to the settlement.

The rerouting of the wall will result in the Palestinian village of Qalqilya, and four others, being on the West Bank side of the barrier.

The barrier has been a contentious issue between Israelis and Palestinians since construction began. Israel's government ignored last year's non-binding ruling by the International Court of Justice which declared the barrier illegal."

Skype, which is based in Luxembourg, has 52 million registered users and is the world's largest VoIP provider. It has been a major success story since its launch in 2003, and has been valued at $2.1 billion by investors.
The company has been looking for a buyer for some time","for US$5 billion. Many believe that eBay intends to enter the rapidly expanding VoIP market and give recent entrants, Google and Microsoft, a run for their money.

The speculation that eBay may buy the small Luxembourg-based company sent their shares down four percent on Wall Street.

Last month, Rupert Murdoch, CEO of News Corporation, was in talks with Skype to possibly buy the company. The talks ended when Skype said the company was not for sale.

Hawi is the third prominent anti-Syrian figure to be assassinated in Lebanon, and the second this month.

It is unclear whether the inexperienced driver of the train survived, 23-year-old Ryujiro Takami with 11 months on the job.

Running late and traveling at what survivors thought was excessive speed, it is believed the train lost control at a bend in the track where 71 km/h (44 mph) was the speed limit; however, any speeds under 134 km/h (83 mph) should not have caused derailment.

The train and aircraft disaster research committee, which reports to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, began to research the disaster. The committee members revealed unofficially the physical reasons of the disaster are quite complexe A member of the committee says the speed of train was monitored and at the fifth train it was recoreded that this car had run at 108 km/h speed in a certain moment after emergency brake had worked."

This is the last scheduled walk for the Expedition 10 crew.

At 06:25 UTC, the two astronauts left the station from the Pirs DC1 docking compartment/airlock and proceeded to install the last three of six space-to-space communication antennas for the ATV's rendezvous and docking with the ISS next year.

Sharipov next deployed the foot long, 11 pound Russian Nanosatellite, tossing it into space by hand. The object of the experiment is to develop small satellite control techniques, monitor satellite
operations and develop new attitude system sensors. Russian ground crews reported good signal reception from the satellite two hours after its release.

The two astronauts next proceeded to the aft end of the Zvezda service module. A Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna and necessary cabling for the ATV was installed and the men worked their way back to the airlock.

The station maintained its attitude, despite the loss of a gyroscope earlier in the space station mission, until the end of the spacewalk. Chiao and Sharipov reported being a safe distance from the attitude adjustment thrusters. Russian ground control activated the jets and normal attitude of
the station was regained.

They returned to the airlock at 1055 UTC, completing the mission an hour earlier than scheduled.

Chiao and Sharipov arrived on the station October 16, 2004. They are scheduled to return to Earth on April 25, 2005. This marks Sharipov's second walk in space and Chiao's sixth."

Hon. Parekura Horomia was ranked at number five, the highest ranking of any Maori MP. The Maori MPs face a strong challenge from the newly formed Maori Party. Shane Jones, the highest placed non-MP, is all but assured of a seat in the next Parliament. Steven Ching is placed at 42, and represents Labour's interest in courting the Asian vote. The Asian population has grown significantly over the past ten years within New Zealand.

The surprising absentee is Hon. George Hawkins, the Minister of Police. He has been criticised for performing poorly in the House, and it is speculated he was offered a low ranking and refused. He is likely to return to Parliament on the basis of his strong hold on the Manurewa electorate seat.

At the time, no other major political party has released its list.

New Zealand changed its electoral system to MMP in 1996, before then it used FPP. In the 2002 election, Labour won 52 seats. Labour then became government in a minority coalition. Elections are held every three years in New Zealand."

The 12 women, selected from 1600 applicants hailing from France,Great Britain, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic began the study after a 20 day screening for baseline comparison data as the study progressed.

The women will conduct all activities from eating, bathing, and reading while lying in hospital beds tilted headfirst at a six degree angle. This particular position, called head-down tilt bed rest was determined from previous studies to remove the vertical load of gravity on the body, inducing changes similar to what astronauts in a genuine weightless environment experience .

Long term exposure to weightlessness creates a number of physiological and psychological problems in astronauts such as:
*Reduced capacity for physical exertion
*Muscle atrophy
*Affects of confinement and isolation
*Impaired circulatory function

A total of 24 women will participate in the study. A second group of 12 will join in September.

Three groups of eight women each will be studied over the course of the two campaigns of bed rest. One group will serve as a control, receiving no specific treatments, the second will exercise, while the third will receive nutritional supplements.

The study is designed to fill in gaps of knowledge on the differences between men and women during extended weightlessness. It also aims to develop countermeasures for reducing the debilitating effects of long spaceflights.

Participating agencies in the study include the European Space Agency, NASA, the French Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency."

"Vladimir Putin has relieved from power Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the head of the Russian navy. This comes a month after an incident","in which a Russian submarine sank in the Barents Sea.
The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that Kuroyedov was relieved of his duties due to health reasons.
The incident in the Barents Sea took place on August 12. The submarine was carrying 14 people, including seven officers. The submarine sank to a depth of 168 meters.
The Defense Ministry said that the submarine was on a training mission.
The Russian navy has been plagued by a series of accidents in recent years.
In 2008","where 7 Russian sailors became trapped in a submarine, and had to be rescued with help from abroad.

No reason was given for Kuroyedov's dismissal, although Admiral Eduard Baltin speculated on Moscow Radio that it may be because of the navy chief's poor health. According to Reuters, he told Ekho Moskvy: ""He has been lying in hospital for two months, he had a complicated operation.""

Admiral Kuroyedov was in charge of the navy during the Kursk disaster of 2000, in which 118 sailors died when their submarine sank. Kuroyedov is being replaced by Vladimir Masorin, who was previously serving as the Chief of staff for the Russian Navy.

In remarks Putin made about this leadership change and referring to Masorin, he said ""The recent exercises, including those I have attended, show that the navy is developing and that is certainly your merit to a large extent."" Putin also added ""at the same time, there were difficult events, tragedies, but I would like to underline once again that with all these problems, all these tragedies, the main thing is that the Navy is undergoing a revival.""

Masorin added while in a hall at the Admiralty, ""One thing is clear — to continue in the condition which we are in and do nothing is simply not possible. I have been given the task of stopping the navy shaking public opinion. I am not experiencing euphoria at being appointed head of the navy. I understand the level of responsibility on my shoulders."""

The President of Romania, Traian Băs","escu, will be in Brussels on April 13, when the European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty.
The President of Romania, Traian Băsescu, will be in Brussels on April 13, when the European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty. The President will meet with the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, and with the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.
The President will also meet with the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, and with","escu, met yesterday with Jonathan Scheele, the head of the European Commission's Delegation to Bucharest, as well as with several European parliamentarians (MEPs). The parties discussed Romania's accession to the EU, which is particularly important as the Accession Treaty is scheduled to be signed late this month, after being voted on by the European Parliament on April 13.

Băsescu told the delegation that European integration remains Romania's first priority at the moment, and that after negotiations were closed with the EU in December 2004, accession became a matter of internal politics rather than foreign affairs.

The MEPs talked to Băsescu about public opinion regarding EU accession in Romania, as well as the impact of accession on the rural population. Judging from recent polls, the overwhelming majority of Romania's population approve EU accession, even though this may be partly due to the fact that many of them have not been adequately informed of the costs of accession. The parliamentarians also discussed the environment and the situation in neighbouring countries, especially Moldova. Tourism was also discussed in the context of promoting Romania's image to European Union citizens.

The delegation also discussed with Băsescu a key issue in Romania's accession process: judicial reform. The Romanian President told the MEPs that Romania has taken bold steps to reform its judiciary and fight corruption. There is also progress towards forming an anti-corruption department within the Internal Ministry of Romania.

As part of Romania's foreign policy, Băsescu also said that, once a member of the European Union, Romania would act as an advocate for other Southeastern European states wishing to join the organisation, as well as seeking to attract public attention to the broader Black Sea region. Romania and Bulgariaare the most advanced countries in Southeastern Europe in terms of EU integration, and will therefore be the first countries in this region to join the 25-nation bloc."

- The National Company for the Management of the State Assets (CNAMAR)
- The National Company for the Management of the State Assets in the Field of Energy (CNAMENERGY)
- The National Company for the Management","end of next year, the government hopes to sell all of its shares in Romtelecom, Romania's largest telecommunications company, which is currently owned by Greece's OTE but which the government maintains a 47% share in. The full privatisation will occur in two phases, with some of the government's existing shares being sold on the Bucharest Stock Exchange this year, and the remainder being sold in 2006.

By 2006, the government also wants to sell its share in Postelecom, another telecommunications operator, and complete the privatisation of the Radiocomunicaţii, the national radio communications company.

The Government also wantes to begin analysis and consulting into the privatisation of Poşta Română, or Romanian Post, the full privatisation of which is set to be completed by 2009 at the latest.

Romania has embarked on a quite comprehensive program of privatisation since 2000, having privatised a part of Romtelecom, as well as full privatisations of several energy distributors and the nation's largest banks, in addition to other smaller companies. However, these privatisations are dwarfed by that of Petrom, Romania's national oil company, which was bought by Austria's OMV in 2004 and is the largest Romanian privatisation ever.

The current Liberal-Democrat governing coalition in Romania has privatisation and economic liberalism as one of its main policies, having also introduced a 16% flat tax rate for personal income and corporate profits at the start of 2005."

Blu-Ray and HD DVD are projected to be the successor formats for current DVDs. Samsung, while leaning towards the Blu-Ray camp, hopes it can cover both bases by distributing a player with dual-compatibility. While this means spending more in development to unify the two technologies and develop a cost-effective production method, dual compatibility may pay off for the company if the formats challenge each other as VHS and Betamax did twenty-five years ago. Despite the support for Blu-Ray, Samsung has also been supportive of a unified standard to avoid such costly competition.

HD DVD offers single layer capacity of 15GB, more than triple the size of standard single layer DVDs, and benefits from similarities with current DVDs, such as cheap production and compatibility with current DVD players. Blu-Ray can hold 23GB on its smallest single layer version, and is reported to have superior durability and interactivity over current DVD-based technology and HD-DVD. HD-DVD is currently promoted by Toshiba, NEC, Sanyo and Microsoft; while Blu-Ray's base of support is the Blu-Ray Disc Association, which is led by Blu-Ray developers Sony and Philips. It is notable that Sony and Philips, who developed the Blu-Ray format, also competed against the Toshiba-designed SuperDisc DVD standard, which is the standard that is followed today.

"Dinamo Moscow came into agreement with FC Porto on a deal bringing two stars of Portugal's national team, Maniche and Costinha into the Russian club",".
The 28-year-old midfielder Maniche, who has been capped 50 times by Portugal, has signed a three-year contract with Dinamo.
The 29-year-old Costinha, who has 55 caps for Portugal, has signed a two-year deal with the Russian club.
Maniche, who has been with Porto since 1999, has won the Portuguese league title three times and the UEFA Champions League once.
Costinha, who has been with Porto since 1998, has won the Portuguese league title twice and",". Their transfer cost was 16 and 4 million euros respectively, making this the most expensive transfer deal in Russian football. The head of Dinamo's board of directors, Alexey Fedorychev, is among the wealthiest Russian businessmen and he is responsible for making the money available to the club. Another Dinamo transfer target is the Greek footballer Seitaridis, also playing for Porto, but this deal has not yet been confirmed.

Meanwhile, in a Russian Premier League match Saturday with Amkar Perm Dinamo Moscow suffered its fourth defeat in a row 1-2, dropping to 9th place. Amkar (one of the poorest teams in Premier League) on the other hand, won the second match in a row. Despite conceding an early goal, Amkar was able to fight back, score from a penalty and secure a slender lead to win the away game.

Despite numerous signings between seasons and hiring a new coach, Oleg Romantsev, Dinamo's performance is far from the best. Last season saw them at 14th place (out of 16), barely avoiding relegation, and the start of a new season isn't promising either. It is yet to be seen, whether the new signings can help the club join the ranks of the top RPL teams, such as Lokomotiv Moscow and CSKA Moscow."
"Irish low fares airline, Ryanair, this week celebrated its 20th birthday. Having reached the milestone, the airline prompt","ly announced a new route from Dublin to the Greek island of Corfu.
The new route will operate twice weekly from 29th March 2013.
Ryanair’s Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs, said: “Ryanair is pleased to celebrate its 20th birthday by launching a new route from Dublin to Corfu, which will operate twice weekly from 29th March 2013.
“Ryanair is pleased to celebrate its 20th birthday by launching a new route from Dublin to Corfu","ly used the opportunity, as always, to sell seats; launching a massive 200,000 seat sale at 99p/99c a seat.

The airline was founded in 1985 by the Irish businessman, Dr Tony Ryan. It began its existence flying a small 15 seat aircraft between Waterford and London Gatwick with the small aim of breaking the duopoly on London-Ireland flights, held at that time by British Airways and Aer Lingus. Today however, the airline now flies to over 200 European destinations with its fleet of 84 Boeing 737's and is awaiting the arrival of a future 225 aircraft from Boeing.

The company today carries as much as 3m passengers a month (depending on the season) and has revealed it made a profit of €245m (USD$307,916,000) in the past year. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated that the airline will carry over 70m passengers annually within five years. The notoriously eccentric Mullingar man went on to tell the press ""The very fact that a Mickey Mouse Irish airline can start in a field in Waterford 20 years ago and in 20 years overtake the world's self-styled, self proclaimed favourite airline is testament to the almost unstoppable demand for low airfare travel around Europe.""

To demonstrate the huge drop in airfares over the last year, the company claimed while the price of a Ryanair seat had dropped from £99.99 in 1985 to 99p today, the price of a pint of beer had trebled and the average house price in England had increased by 500%."

The Venezuelan government has recognized that the mother of Ugueth Urbina, Maura Josefina Villareal, was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2002.
The recognition was made by the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, Nicolas Maduro, during a meeting with the mother of the former Major League Baseball pitcher, who is currently in Venezuela.
“We have recognized that Maura Villareal was kidnapped by the FARC in 2002","of Colombia (FARC-EP) commander Alvis Patiño, known as El Chiguiro. Urbina is a Venezuelan and a Major League Baseball right-handed closer who plays for the Detroit Tigers.

Chiguiro has been captured on February 2005. A delegation of authorities from Colombia was sent to Venezuela, so he could be identified. Now, after his identification, Colombian officers expects he can be extradicted to Colombia. In Colombia, Chiguiro is expected to be judged for the alleged crimes of kidnapping and murderer of the American missionaries Sthephen Everet and Thimoty Dike in 1995.

Some Venezuelan baseball players from the Major Leagues said that kidnapping is a new situation they must learn to live with. None of them said that the risk of kidnappings would prevent their return to Venezuela.

For years, Venezuelan cattlemen near Colombian borders say that they are victims of extorsion by FARC forces. This is the first time that the Venezuelan government recognizes that the FARC is responsible by this kind of crime in Venezuela.

According to the Colombian authorities, Chiguiro is envolved with the exchange of drugs by weapons with Brazilian traffic drug dealers."

In a scene repeated across much of America, each morning a group of day laborers, mostly immigrants, assemble by a 7-Eleven convenience store in the hopes of getting work.

Each day, nearly 200 people gather near the nation's capital in Herndon, Virginia; these laborers do much of the hard and dangerous work not wanted by most U.S. citizens. This daily gathering has drawn both the ire and compassion of the Herndon community. A public hearing Monday night to discuss a new plan drew an overflowing crowd to the Town Council chambers. The Commission said so many people signed up to speak at the hearing that the panel will need to convene again Tuesday night.

For years groups and businesses among the community who want to help the day laborers have been working on the issue. In a plan spearheaded by Bill Threlkeld, of the group Project Hope and Harmony, they lobbied Herndon officials to use taxpayer money to build a regulated day laborer center in an old police station at the edge of town. This they say would get the day-laborer group(s) off the street. The plan has the backing of Herndon mayor, Michael L. O'Reilly.

The plan would also combine the opening of the center with a new local ordinance that would make it a misdemeanor crime for a laborer to seek work at any location other than the official one. Opponents of the plan say the town would be aiding illegal immigrants if it established the center.

A Pew Hispanic Center survey found a 25% increase over four years in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The number now is estimated to have reached about 10.3 million. Local governments do not have the authority to enforce national immigration laws, so the town of Herndon must rely on federal officials, who show little interest in getting involved."

The bulge is located 25 miles outside of the city of Bend, Ore. and three miles from the South Sister.

The results of this years survey won't be available for some weeks, but geologists have come to some conclusions based on the past four years of monitoring. The intial discovery was made by using information from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Interferometric Satellite Aperture Radar satellite. Scientists believe the bulge is rising at a rate of 1.4 inches per year and is due to a large lake of fluid (likely magma) that is 4.5 miles below the surface. They also think the fluid covers an area about one mile across and extends to a depth of 65 feet. The pooling fluid could be shifting magma or the creation of a new volcano.

Ground swells aren't an extraodinary occurrence in geology. Geologists suspect that these ground swellings occur in the Cascade Range and at other volcanoes, and the majority of them do not lead to eruptions. Using the same ESA satellite technology, geologists have seen lots of bulges in the Aleutian Islands that have not lead to eruptions."

Carpatair has grown very quicly in the past two years, adding several new destinations, both in Romania and abroad. Also, it has taken away many of TAROM's customers on international routes because it provides direct connections from Transylvanian cities such as Arad and Timişoara to German and Italian cities, saving customers the task of changing flights at Bucharest.

The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in African countries per year has quadrupled since 1990, and continues to rise. Now 540,000 people die of the disease in Africa every year.

Worldwide, TB kills two million people a year; the only deadlier disease in the world is HIV/AIDS.

Some African countries such as Tanzania and Malawi pioneered TB control strategies that were later adopted around the globe. But they were not successful - Malawi saw the number of TB cases a year rise by four times over the past 15 years. Poverty, poor health systems and HIV have been blamed by the WHO for this.

Funding is a particularly critical issue. Eight of the nine worst affected African countries reported that, for 2003, they had short-falls in the funding their TB control programmes needed. However the WHO stresses that money alone will not end the crisis - health systems must be improved, and the rate at which health professionals are lost in the region must be reduced.

Africa is the only region in the world to be experiencing an increase in TB cases - in the rest of the world, infection rates are either stable or falling."

Two Israeli motorists escaped uninjured in the West Bank today after coming under fire from Palestinian gunmen.

Elsewhere, Hamas militant Hassan Alami was found dead in the Khan Younis camp of Southern Gaza, killed while carrying out activities for the group. Although Hamas refused to be bound by the agreement signed yesterday in Sharm el-Sheik, it has promised to keep quiet at the request of Mahmoud Abbas.

Another Palestinian man is in a critical condition after being shot in the chest. The man, from the Rafah refugee camp, was shot near the Israeli settlement of Atzmona. The Israeli army, which has a garrison in Atzmona, is looking into the incident.

Meanwhile, Ramallah has accused Lebanese rebel group Hezbollah of attempting to sabotage the fragile peace agreement in the Middle East. The group, backed by Syria and Iran, are attempting to recruit Palestinian militants to engage in attacks of Israeli targets, claim Palestinian spokesmen. The charges mirror those made recently by Israel, which has long accused Hezbollah of bankrolling Palestinian violence in the region.

Hezbollah denies the charges, and claims to be honouring the ceasefire agreed yesterday. However, Palestinian officials claim to have intercepted bank records and email communications that prove that the guerilla group is recruiting militants in the West Bank. Abbas is shying away from any confrontation with the group at the moment, but has sent an envoy to Beirut to persuade Hezbollah to desist from its aggressive activities.

Despite the setbacks, Israel has begun to lift restrictions of travel and issue permits to 1000 Palestinians to work in Israel, as part of Tuesday's deal. Sharon has agreed to travel to Ramallah to continue talks toward peace in the region."

American manufacturing giant Proctor &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) plans to acquire Gillette Co. for US$5,"7 billion in stock, the companies announced on Monday.
The deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2005, will create the world's largest consumer products company, with combined annual sales of US$83 billion.
The combined company will have 130,000 employees and 300 brands, including P&amp;G's Tide, Pampers and Crest, and Gillette's Duracell, Oral-B and Braun.
The deal is the latest in a series of mergers and acquisitions in","7 billion in stock. The purchase plan calls for P&amp;G to swap 0.975 shares of its stock per share of Gillete Co. P&amp;G also announced a stock buyback program in which they would purchase up to US$22 billion of shares over the next 18 months. Including the stock buyback program, the merger is being financed by 60 percent stock and 40 percent cash.

P&amp;G is known for brands such as Ariel and Tide washing powder, Max Factor cosmetics, Pringles potato crisps (chips) and Hugo Boss and Lacoste perfumes.

Gillette, known for brands such as Gillette razors, Oral B dental care, and Duracell batteries, has had growing problems with the growth of private labels and price cuts demanded by large supermarkets.

After the acquisition is completed, Gillette's CEO James Kilts will be P&amp;G's vice-chairman. Kilts said that he expects that this acquisition will cause additional mergers to take place.

""I believe the consumer product industry needs to consolidate,"" said Kilts, ""we believe we can bring these companies together and create a juggernaut.""

P&amp;G and Gillette have a combined market capitalization of about $185 billion US, which will make it the largest in the sector.

The early morning announcement states that 6,000 employees will be eliminated. Most of the layoffs will result from reducing overlapping management positions and other supporting positions within the combined company.

Court officials say the arrest order was delivered to Gen. Pinochet's home near the capital, Santiago, Wednesday. The 89-year-old retired general has been at his home recovering from a stroke he suffered in late December.

The crimes were allegedly committed as part of Operation Condor, a campaign of assassination and terrorization meant to suppress left-wing opposition to Pinochet's regime. The Chilean-led program soon spread to other military regimes throughout Latin America, and may have had at least tacit complicity by then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The Pinochet dictatorship ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990, gaining power after a military coup overthrew the democratically-elected socialist President Salvador Allende."

The 1999","French opera, by Camille Saint-Saens, is of an artist ""whose life is dictated by a love for drugs and Japan."" As a result, the performers smoke cannabis joints on stage, and the theatre itself is encouraging the audience to join in.

Artistic director Bernhard Glocksin says that the theatre is claiming the metaphorical ""artistic licence"", to excuse the actions of the actors and audience, which are against German law. Glocksin was quoted by Ananova as saying opera would be ""improved with a few joints and some appetising lines"", noting the production was partly an experiment, to see what they could ""get away with.""

""Artistic licence"" is at par to an ""artistic liberty"", where something is exaggerated or changed for the sake of the art itself. For example a visual artist painting a landscape might move a tree to another area of their work, for better balance, or a poet ignoring pentameter when writing a traditional sonnet."

"The new leader of Togo, the late president Gnassingbé Eyadéma's son, Faure Gnassingb","é, has been sworn in as president.
The ceremony took place in the capital, Lomé, in the presence of several African leaders.
Mr Gnassingbé, 39, was sworn in as president on Saturday after the death of his father, who had ruled the country for 38 years.
The BBC's West Africa correspondent, Mark Doyle, says the ceremony was a low-key affair, with no crowds in the streets.
Mr Gnassingbé was sworn in by the speaker of parliament, Abass Bonfoh, in the","é, pledged to hold ""free and transparent elections which reflect the will of the people"" as soon as possible, though he did not mention a specific timeframe, nor did he address international criticism of his ascession to power.

Togolese politics have become a subject of criticism by the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations after the death of Eyadéma late last week. Eyadéma was Africa's longest-ruling leader whose 38-year rule was marked by government-sponsored violence and the stifling of political expression.

The Constitution of Togo was amended to permit Eyadéma to retain power, to allow more than two five-year terms in office, and to lower the minimum age for a president from 45 to 35. The latter move was seen as a way to allow the succession of the presidency to Eyadéma's son, then only 35 years old.

When Eyadéma died on Saturday of a heart attack, the country's Constitution called for power to be transferred to the head of the national assembly. Instead, Faure Gnassingbé assumed power and the Constitution was amended to allow this, causing criticism from foreign commentators.

Faure Gnassingbé also promised reforms, and an open dialog with the opposition parties. However, with the opposition leader out of the country since an assassination attempt in 1992, and the presidential term not set to expire until 2008, it is not clear how much change these promises will bring in the near future."

Luigi R. Einaudi, the former Assistant Secretary General, is serving as Acting Secretary General until the OAS decides who will serve for the remainder of the current term of office.

Before Menchú was nominated, the Central American states had decided that the candidate should be from Central America. But the Rodriguez scandal has made it difficult for the Central American states to find another candidate they could all endorse.

Chile and Mexico have proposed their own candidate for the job.

President Oscar Berger of Guatemala agrees that Menchú should be the Central American candidate. Menchú has said that if the Central American nations are in agreement, she will happily stand as their candidate.

An indigenous Guatemalan, Menchú won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, and was also prominent in her opposition to the previous FRG government which Berger defeated.

The investigations are being carried out by the ICTR, which is based in Arusha, Tanzania.
The ICTR was set up in 1994 to prosecute those responsible for the genocide.
The spokesperson said that the investigations were being carried out by the ICT","erson for the traditional Gacaca courts. The courts are a form of community based justice that were set up in an attempt to deal with the nearly 100,000 people accused of war crimes.

""Work is progressing quite fast in most places across Rwanda. We are looking at finalizing the investigation phase by the end of July"", said the spokesman, Innocent Musafiri.

The courts were set up three years ago, however so far their time has been taken up with trial runs. There are 10,000 courts across the country, and they are expected to take eight years to process all accused. Regular courts would have taken up to 100 years. The judges are untrained citizens elected by their peers.

The 1994 Rwandan genocide was an eruption of ethnic conflict where Hutu militia, supported by the Hutu dominated government and encouraged by 'hate radio', attempted to ethnically cleanse the minority Tutsi. Despite numerous warnings the international community did not take serious action to prevent the atrocities, which included hacking people to death with machetes, and forcing people into buildings that were then destroyed with bulldozers. Estimates place the number killed at up to one million."

The Sterne strain is not thought to be harmful to humans, but the intended use of the anthrax remains unclear, worrying anti-biological weapons activists. Other recent Dugway contracts for equipment to produce unspecified biolgical agents in 3,000 litre batches are even more concerning to activists.

The contracts were uncovered by The Sunshine Project, a group opposed to biological weapons development based in Germany. The work involved seems to cast doubts on the ability of the US to live up to its commitments to the Biological Weapons Convention. The post 9/11 anthrax attack upon the U.S. used weaponized U.S. Army anthrax , most likely produced at Fort Detrick.

"A month after the Cook County Board of Commissioners unanimously voted to welcome the 2006 Gay Games to Chicago, the five Republicans","on the board have reversed course and are now calling for the games to be moved to another city.
The five commissioners, led by Commissioner Tony Peraica, have introduced a resolution that calls for the games to be moved to another city.
""The Gay Games are not a sporting event, but a political event,"" Peraica said in a statement. ""The Gay Games are not about sports, but about promoting a lifestyle that is not accepted by the majority of Americans.""
The games are scheduled to be held in Chicago in July 2006.
The resolution, which was","on the board withdrew their names under pressure from conservative activists. Chicago is located in Cook County.

The Gay Games is an Olympics-style multi-day international sports competition targeted to LGBT athletes.

Commissioners Gregg Goslin, Liz Gorman, Carl Hansen, Tony Peraica and Peter Silvestri, the only Republicans sitting on the Board of Commissioners withdrew their names from the proclamation. ""I'm a pro-family kind of person and conservative on social issues. That's nothing against the gay and lesbian community, but it's nothing I want to advance as a cause celebre,"" Peraica told the Chicago Sun-Times. In the same report, Gorman said that she doesn't support ""special rights for any group.""

An anti-gay rights lobbying group, the Illinois Family Institute (IFI), says it is trying to get Democrat commissioners to also withdraw their names from the official welcome. ""There is a difference between tolerating and celebrating homosexuality,"" Peter LaBarera, a spokesman for the group said in an Associated Press interview. The IFI also expressed concern about taxpayer money being used to promote the event.

Although Gay Games spokeswoman Tracy Baim she said she was not surprised by the reversal of the five commissioners, Mike Quigley, a Democrat Cook County Commissioner said of the retraction of his colleagues, ""It's a blinding bias and animosity that is overriding human interest, job creation, economic development and the whole spirit of athletic competition."" Quigley was the sponsor of the proclamation and plans to play ice hockey in the games.

The 12 other commissioners who voted for the welcome proclamation maintained their support for the event, which is scheduled to run from July 15 to July 22, 2006 and projected to generate between $50 million and $80 million in tourist business to the city and county."

The next round of elections are scheduled for the end of October although it is widely believed this date is unlikely to be met.

The peace process in Cote d'Ivoire has been on shaky ground following the failure of the rebel forces to begin the disarmament process originally scheduled for 31 July.

Canadian military officials are being accused of covering up the use of the deadly chemical agent Agent Orange and other defoliants during the 1950,"s and 1960s.
Agent Orange was used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War to destroy the jungle canopy and expose enemy troops.
The chemical was banned in Canada in 1989.
But a new report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation says the military used the chemical in the 1950s and 1960s to clear forests in the Canadian Arctic.
The report says the military used Agent Orange and other defoliants to clear forests in the Canadian Arctic.
The report says the military used the chemical","s and 1960s at a New Brunswick base.

At a public meeting attended by at least 200 people, defence officials said only a small amount of the herbicide was used, over a total of seven days between 1966 and 1967 at the army base to clear foliage to prevent fires during artillery training and to clear the view for soldiers.

The American military was also given permission by the Canadian military to test Agent Orange, Agent Purple, and Agent White during the Vietnam War on less than 500 acres of the Canadian base.

Thursday’s public meeting followed in the aftermath of recent media reports that a U.S. army report indicated the use of Agent Purple, which is considered three-times more toxic than Agent Orange, as part of the spraying program.

When revelations about the use of Agent Purple first surfaced in mid-June, retired sergeant, Earl Graves, said, “They were out in the exercise area and the planes flew over spraying and they were told to just put ponchos over their head, that it wouldn’t hurt them.”

He said 170 soldiers in his regiment died of cancer and many of them died young.

At the public meeting held Thursday afternoon, angry and fearful civilians and veterans voiced fears that the chemicals were responsible for illnesses later developed.

Veteran John Chisholm said soldiers were told the sprays were harmless and to keep their mouths shut. “Now we found out this stuff here is killing us. No wonder all my buddies are dead.”

The Defence Department said Thursday that it was conducting tests to determine the dioxin level in the soil and consulting with the U.S. military to find out the exact carcinogen levels in the sprays used."

"In an interview by John D. O'Connor for the American magazine Vanity Fair, it was revealed that W. Mark Felt, a former","FBI official, was Deep Throat, the anonymous source who leaked information to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein during the Watergate scandal.
Felt, who was the deputy director of the FBI, was the second highest-ranking official in the FBI at the time. He was also the number two man in the FBI's investigation of the Watergate break-in.
Felt was a friend of Woodward's and had been a source of information for him for several years. He was also a friend of Bernstein's.
Felt was a source of information","associate director of the FBI during the Nixon Administration, was the anonymous informer called ""Deep Throat"". ""Deep Throat"" helped journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bring down then-president Richard Milhous Nixon through the exposure of the Watergate scandal.

Previously bound by a pledge not to reveal ""Deep Throat's"" identity until after his death, Woodward and Bernstein at first refused to confirm the Vanity Fair report. However, in a story posted late today on the Washington Post website, they verified that Felt was ""Deep Throat.""

However, one of Richard Nixon's biographers, Jonathan Aitken, believes that at least one of ""Deep Throat's"" tips could not have been known by Felt. The Post first reported on the famous 18 1/2 minute gap in a crucial tape at a time when only six people were aware of its existence -- none of them Felt. This raises the possibility that ""Deep Throat,"" though mainly based on Felt, may be a composite character.

Felt has been mentioned as a leading candidate for ""Deep Throat"" by many that have tried to solve the mystery. An article published in the American Journalism Review last fall claimed Carl Bernstein's son once exposed Felt as the mysterious informer. But until now, Felt, Woodward, Bernstein and the Post's former editor Ben Bradlee have all denied it.

Felt, 91, has reportedly been in poor health in recent years. His family says Felt admits to being the source and described him as feeling proud of his role in history and having ""a big grin"" when told of the Vanity Fair article."

"A search in Wikinews for ""Inquiry"" will return many examples of Public Inquiries conducted by governmental organizations into issues that are often","of great public interest.

The processes and terms of reference of such 'Public' Inquiries are normally determined by the commissioning governmental body. However the Internet has now made possible the emergence of a new type of Public Inquiry, called an ""E-Inquiry"" that appears to be not only independent of government but also, like a Wiki, enables anyone who wishes to partake in the Inquiry to do so by contributing evidence and by posing questions that contribute to the process of determining the Terms of reference of the E-Inquiry.

The absence of a US government sponsored independent public inquiry into the Katrina hurricane disaster could well be the spur that led to the development of a new non-profit web site that incorporates a framework for conducting a Public E-Inquiry. That site http://www.ForumKatrina.org carries the banner line ""Katrina Support, Recovery, Planning &amp; E-Inquiry"".

The web site owners have given permission to quote the following extract from its statement on the web site about the objective of its E-Inquiry:

""Everyone who may think of getting involved in the E-Inquiry is asked to remember, at every stage in the process, that the end purpose of the E-Inquiry is to provide recommendations, for the future. The objective of those recommendations is to help everyone to avoid death, disease and destruction in consequence of forthcoming natural and man-made disasters. If those recommendations are to be taken seriously, and this, the first E-Inquiry, is to acquire any public credibility, then the process must be democratic, patently fair and intellectually rigorous.""

It will be interesting to see whether an E-Inquiry is capable of meeting these ideals and whether they become a common feature of internet activity."

The treaty's content has been posted online in order to inform Romanians of the costs, standards and responsibilities of European Union accession. The text was published after the European Commission asked for Romania and Bulgaria to better inform their citizens of what EU accession actually means. Bulgaria similarly made available the content of the treaty, in the Bulgarian language, in early April.

The photo in question originally showed Matts and the Conservative front-bencher Anne Widdecombe campaigning on behalf of an immigrant family living in Weymouth, in the Dorset South constituency, in March last year.

When the photo appeared in Matts' campaign literature, the people in the background were removed from the photo and a slogan calling for the family to be allowed to stay was replaced by one calling for immigration control.

The seat, taken by Labour's Jim Knight in the 2001 general election, is one of the most fiercely contested in the country, being Labour's smallest majority.

Conservative leader Michael Howard condemned Matts' behaviour but refused to sack him. Conservative shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin, from neighbouring Dorset West, said that the message on the doctored photo was consistent with conservative policy.

A statement from the president's office said Mr. Osomo was sacked after the sale of public property violated instructions. According to a BBC report, the Minister allocated more than 200 properties to top officials rather than going on public sale.

President Obasanjo has been vocal in tackling corruption and reportedly warned officials their greed is undermining his attempts to win international debt relief. In March, he fired Education Minister Fabian Osuji in a broadcast to the nation during which he said 14 people had been involved in fraud and accused Mr. Osuji of offering a bribe of 55 million naira (US$417,000) to senate president Adolfus Wabara in order to get a bigger budget for his ministry."

Dr. Schoenthaler is well-known for a youth detention center study where violations of house rules fell by 37% when vending machines were removed and the cafeteria replaced canned food by fresh alternatives. He summarizes his findings by saying that “Having a bad diet right now is a better predictor of future violence than past violent behaviour.” In a very large test, Schoenthaler directed a study in meals at 803 New York City schools, in low-income neighbourhoods, finding that the number of students passing final exams increased by 16%.

Critics have questioned some of Dr. Schoenthaler findings, due to the lack of placebo control groups. However, more recent work by Dr. Bernard Gesch, a physiologist at the University of Oxford, has placed some of the work on a more scientific footing. Dr. Gesch found that nutrition supplements produced a 26% drop in violations of prison rules over a placebo, and a 37% decrease in violent offences. The Netherlands has embarked on a wider scale dietary research program in 14 prisons.

The short term behaviour consequences of ingesting sugar are well understood: an initial burst on energy, followed a sugar low in which your body produces adrenalin, which makes you irritable and explosive. However, Schoenthaler and Gesch suggest that there are long term impacts over and above the short term consequences of blood sugar variations."

The 1999–2000 season was the 100th season in the existence of FC Barcelona and","came close to victory themselves, however Steven Harminson took the wicket of Michael Kasprovic to clinch victory on the fourth day of the game.

The match looked to be in Englands hands following sterling batting from Kevin Pietersen (71, 20) and Andrew Flintoff (68, 73) which left the Australians needing to score 282 to win the match. The tourists were soon in trouble ending the third day at 175-8 with over 100 runs still to score and only 2 wickets in hand.

However on the fourth morning the Australian tailenders scored steadily and despite the loss of Shane Warne for 42 the final wicket pair closed in on the target.

The Edgbaston crowd were reduced to biting their nails as the match came down to the wire; Australia needing just 3 runs to win and England needing just one wicket.

Harmison produced a lifting delivery from just short of a length which Kasprovic could only fend off with a glove through to the England 'keeper Geraint Jones, leaving Australia agonisingly short of a memorable win and the series all square at one match each with three to play.

Scores: England 407 and 182, Australia 308 and 279"

WHEREAS, the United States Constitution provides that the House","ITED STATES CONGRESS TO INITIATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST PRESIDENT BUSH, VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY AND DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS

:WHEREAS, the Downing Street Memo shows that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld began planning and executing the war on Iraq before seeking Congressional and UN approval;

:WHEREAS, UN weapons inspectors showed prior to the invasion that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; and

:WHEREAS, there is further mounting evidence that the Administration lied or misled about ""mushroom clouds,"" ""connections to 9/11,"" and ""war as a last resort"" as they sought UN, Congressional, and public approvals;

:THEREFORE, RESOLVED, the DPW asks Congress to immediately begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.

The resolution alleges that the Bush administration ""lied or misled"" Congress and the American people concerning the justification for the war. The ""Downing Street memo"" and reports from U.N. weapons inspectors are mentioned as evidence of deception.

Newly elected state party Chairman Joe Wineke said, ""Democrats, not only in Wisconsin but throughout the U.S., have been outraged by what we believe has been a clear cover-up of why the U.S. went into Iraq,"" and that the resolution expresses ""the sense of frustration that Democrats in Wisconsin have over fighting a war for the wrong reasons.""

Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor, does not think the resolution will be successful and said that even if the House of Representatives began impeachment proceedings against the president and vice president, ""I don't think you can impeach the secretary of defense""."

""The first criminal attack was committed in one church at Muhuta district where a group of FNL fighters fired in the church and killed six people including a pastor. They also injured seven others"", Manirakiza said.

He said the rebels shot dead a local government official and his brother and also kidnapped a policeman in the same district.

""We don't know yet why these people were killed, they may be executed because they refused to adhere to the FNL ideology, as the area where they have been killed is an FNL stronghold.""

Some 300,000 people have been killed since the fighting began in 1993.

Fresh talks between the government and the FNL have raised hopes among diplomats that Burundi can finally lift one of its last big barriers to peace.

Its leader Agathon Rwasa and Burundi President, Domitien Ndayizeye signed on May 15 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a cessation of hostilities deal seen as a significant step toward finally bringing the rebels into the peace process.

Firefox browsers infected by malicious code could experience a buffer overflow, temporarily locking up or ""freezing"" a user's computer, or even executing arbitrary code which could take over a user's computer.

The flaw was discovered and reported by Internet Security Systems, Inc. The upgrade was the second major security fix in less than a month for the browser, which has grown in popularity to ten percent of the browser market in the United States.

Although there were no known exploits of the bug, Chris Hoffman, director of engineering at Mozilla, told reporters, ""because Mozilla is committed to delivering the most secure product possible, we decided to quickly issue an update to patch the bug.""

The Mozilla Foundation did not offer any details about the issue of vulnerability, but a second major security overhaul in such a short time underscores challenges faced by the nonprofit foundation as it goes head-to-head with the market leading Internet Explorer browser by Microsoft.

And what a show it was. The first batter in the 2005 Home Run Derby, Abreu proceeded to shatter the previous record of 15 home runs in a round, belting 24, including a 517-foot moonshot that exited the stadium in right field, going through two bats in the process. This rampage came immediately after ESPN announcers Chris Berman and Joe Morgan described Comerica Park, the site of the Derby, as a difficult park to hit home runs in.

In the second round, Abreu edged past Boston's David Ortiz (who himself hit an astounding 17 homeruns in the first round) and Milwaukee's Carlos Lee to earn a spot in the finals alongside Detroit star Ivan Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who snuck into the second round with 7 dingers, swatted the most in the second round, but his home-field advantage deserted him in the finals as Abreu smashed 11 over the fences to win the Derby for his native Venezuela.

Abreu's three-round total of 41 homers broke Miguel Tejada's record of 27, set last year in Houston's Minute Maid Park."

On that day, FreeCulture.org will organize web-based writers to relate their experiences and thoughts on open-access to governmental records and freely available public information. Webloggers will be encouraged to highlight the need to have public records available in electronic formats to facilitate easier searching of information and more widespread access. Another goal of Blogshine Sunday is to emphasize that open access to governmental information should be granted to everyone, unpaid reporters and bloggers as well as professional journalists.

Recently, bloggers have played an important role in shaping public opinion about issues that were initially overlooked by traditional media. Freerepublic.com blogger Harry W. MacDougald was the first to scrutinize documents that suggested that President Bush was derelict in his military service in the 1970s. CBS News reported on the documents as if they were legitimate, but MacDougald discovered that the documents used a typestyle that was not available at the time they were supposedly written. Following MacDougald’s blog posts questioning the documents, CBS said that they regretted reporting on the documents as though they were authentic. Since bloggers are generally unpaid and do not have the editorial restrictions of professional journalists, as the MacDougald example illustrates, they are sometimes better able to research and report on issues not covered by traditional media.

Blogshine Sunday is held in conjunction with Sunshine Sunday, when professional journalists and news media will publish articles and editorials on the importance of the open records. Freeculture.org was started last April by two college students in an effort to show that technology can better facilitate public affairs involvement.

Her lawyer reported before the verdict was handed down that she was terrified. ""She's probably the worst I've ever seen her,"" he said.

After the verdict she stopped briefly to hug her family before being loaded into a van and driven away.

Corby was arrested at Denpasar Airport last October. On her trip to Bali, she flew from Brisbane to Sydney and then changed planes. Her defense centered around the claim that Australian airport baggage handlers placed the drugs in her bodyboard bag as part of a drug smuggling ring. It was claimed that the drugs were being smuggled from Brisbane to Sydney, but for some reason were not removed before her luggage was transferred to the Indonesian flight.

After a lengthy trial that attracted much media attention in Australia, prosecutors called for the judges to hand down a life sentence.

Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that he felt for Corby but that Australians had to trust the Indonesian justice system. ""We have to respect the justice system of other countries,"" he said.

The judge said she had until next Wednesday to appeal."
