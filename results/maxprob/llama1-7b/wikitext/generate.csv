" In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Copán , whose founder K 'inich Yax K 'uk","' Mo' was a descendant of the great king of Tikal. The city was abandoned in the 9th century, but the Maya continued to live in the area.
In the 10th century the Maya of the Petén region were conquered by the K'iche' Maya, who established the city of Quiché. The K'iche' Maya were in turn conquered by the Itza Maya in the 12th century. The Itza Maya established their capital at Tayasal, which was conquered by the Spanish in 1697.","' Mo ' was clearly connected with Tikal . Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal . K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Copán in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan .

At the same time , in late 426 , Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries . "

The low was upgraded to Tropical Storm Josephine at 1800 UTC on September 7 .
Josephine continued to move northwestward, and the storm began to intensify. The storm's maximum sustained winds increased to 65 mph (100 km/h) at 0000 UTC on September 8 . The storm's forward motion slowed to a near-stationary position, and Josephine began to turn to the north. The storm'","system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave .

She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold Schoenberg , Darius Milhaud , Béla Bartók , and Paul Hindemith . The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . She opened with Alexander 's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin , then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin : I 'll Build a Stairway to Paradise , Innocent Ingénue Baby , and Swanee . Gershwin played the piano for these pieces . Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann @-@ Heink , Virgil Thomson , and Paul Whiteman . Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art .

The skull of _Panderichthys_ is very similar to that of _Panderichthys_ , but the skull of _Panderich","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the backlot , on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed . The inside of the Burnhams ' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the Fitts ' home was shot in the city 's Hancock Park neighborhood . Ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his "" monkish "" personality , while at the same time blending with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side .

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","himself in charge of the British Red Cross Society's work in France. He was appalled by the conditions in the hospitals and the lack of care for the wounded. He was also shocked by the number of men who were dying of wounds that could have been treated if they had been properly cared for.
Ware was determined to do something about this. He was a man of action and he was not going to wait for the government to do something. He decided to set up a hospital in France that would be run by volunteers. He was determined that the hospital would be run on the principles of the","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission .

" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","internal fertilization , but some may have been ovoviviparous .

Temnospondyls","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
