The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The Tetrarchs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "

" With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel",", the HMVS Victoria , which was used to suppress the Eureka Rebellion .
The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) was formed on 10 July 1901, with the amalgamation of the Commonwealth Naval Forces and the separate colonial navies. The RAN was initially a small force, with only two vessels given to it at federation, HMAS Cerberus and HMAS Pyramus . The RAN also took over the duties of the colonial navies, including the Queensland Maritime Defence Force and the New South Wales Marine Brigade .

It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sinop , spelled the end of the wooden @-@ hulled warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot , which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power . "
" However , the remnant low associated with Josephine began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 . Convection around the","center of circulation became more organized and the low began to move northwestward . The low was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on September 7 , and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 1800 UTC .

The JTWC upgraded Kilo to a tropical storm at 0600 UTC on September","system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas . However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . "
 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . W,"are's first cemetery was opened in 1854 at the corner of the present day Ware and Wareham Roads. The cemetery was named the Wareham Road Cemetery.
Wareham Road Cemetery was the first of three cemeteries opened by Ware. The second was the Wareham Road Cemetery Extension, which was opened in 1860. The third was the Wareham Road Cemetery Extension No. 2, which was opened in 1870.
The Wareham Road Cemetery was the first of the three","are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in perpetuity , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government . "

  The skull of _Tiktaalik_ is intermediate between those of fish and tetrap","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF,"'s capabilities. The ADF's role in East Timor was a significant factor in the decision to acquire the F/A-18F Super Hornets.
  The F/A-18F Super Hornet is a multi-role fighter aircraft that can be used for air-to-air combat, air-to-ground attack, reconnaissance and electronic warfare. It is a twin-engine, single-seat aircraft with a maximum speed of Mach 1.8 (1,190 mph, 1,915 km/h) and a","'s ability to conduct operations outside Australia . This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF 's ability to mount and sustain such operations .

" During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and","the Soviet Union, Australia would be drawn into the conflict. The Australian government was concerned that the country's geographical position, and the fact that it was a member of the British Commonwealth, would make it a likely target for Soviet aggression. The Australian government was also concerned that the country's defence forces were inadequate to defend the country against a Soviet attack.
In response to these concerns, the Australian government began to develop a series of defence plans to prepare the country for the possibility of a Soviet attack. The first of these plans was the Defence (General Purpose) Program 1950–","Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and RAN . "
" Beginning in January 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying the Tetrarchs and their crews inside Hamilcar","gliders.

 In the early 1990s a group of newly observant members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue,". The group was led by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, who had been the rabbi of the synagogue since 1983. Riskin was a charismatic figure who had been ordained by the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary of Yeshiva University. He had been a rabbi in New York and then in Israel, where he had been the chief rabbi of Efrat, a settlement in the West Bank. He was a strong supporter of the settlement movement and had been a leader in the religious Zionist movement.
Riskin was a",", complete with a mechitza , a partition separating men and women . The "" more feminist @-@ minded "" members strongly objected to having a mechitza anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building , even if it were not in the services they attended .

Kinberg also signed the petition . Faced with this opposition , in 1992 the Orthodox members left , renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi , creating Eugene 's second synagogue , originally called "" The Halachic Minyan "" , and in 1998 renamed "" Congregation Ahavas Torah "" .

## Background

In 1985, a group of musicians and activists formed Artists United Against Apartheid to protest the South African policy of apartheid. The group's first project was a recording of the song ""Sun City"", written by Steven Van Zandt, which was released as a single in 1985 and was a hit in the United States, reaching number 13 on","In 1985 , Bono participated in Steven Van Zandt 's anti @-@ apartheid Sun City project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones . When Richards and Jagger played blues , Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre , as most of U2 's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid @-@ 1970s . Bono realised that U2 "" had no tradition "" , and he felt as if they "" were from outer space "" . This inspired him to write the blues @-@ influenced song "" Silver and Gold "" , which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood . It was re @-@ recorded by U2 for the "" Where the Streets Have No Name "" single while the band returned to Dublin during in May 1987 during a break between the first and second legs of The Joshua Tree Tour . The song was described by Musician as "" tough and raw , with Bono in husky and confident voice , underpinned by a sinuous bass line , and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues @-@ based guitar . "" "" Silver and Gold "" was played live on The Joshua Tree Tour several times , one performance of which was featured on the band 's 1988 album and rockumentary , Rattle and Hum . Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of The Joshua Tree . The studio version was also included on the limited edition B @-@ sides bonus disk of the band 's first compilation album , The Best of 1980 – 1990 . "

" The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner backlot 's "" Blondie Street "" for the Burnham and Fitts ' homes .","The Burnham house was built on the north side of the street, while the Fitts house was built on the south side.

The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. Fitts — watching from Ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex . Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the backlot , on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed . The inside of the Burnhams ' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the Fitts ' home was shot in the city 's Hancock Park neighborhood . Ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his "" monkish "" personality , while at the same time blending with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side . The production deliberately minimized the use of red , as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere . The Burnhams ' home uses cool blues , while the Fitts ' is kept in a "" depressed military palette "" . "

ZIPRA presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka . About 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp , with senior ZIPRA staff also on site . The Rhodesian operation 's other targets were Chikumbi , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of Lusaka , and Mkushi Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia . Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked . "
 Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following,"the failure of the first landing at Cape Helles, the second landing was made at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. The Anzacs were to land on the Aegean coast of the Gallipoli Peninsula, north of Gaba Tepe, in an area that was to become known as Anzac Cove.

" Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge",".
  Bacon's work is characterized by the use of bold, flat colors applied in layers, and violent, disjointed, abstracted or distorted figures, usually isolated from any backgrounds.
  Bacon's art is typically described and analyzed in terms of the artists's interest in the themes of the human body, and particularly in the ways in which it appears to change and deform over time, and the artist's interest in expressing emotions.
  Bacon's work is noted for its bold, austere, and often grotesque or nightmarish",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas "" in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . "" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . "" This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","himself in France with a group of British reservists. He was appalled by the lack of care for the wounded and the dead on the battlefield. He organised a team of volunteers to recover bodies from the battlefield and to bury them in individual graves.
Ware's team was successful in recovering and burying the bodies of 250,000 soldiers. The team was known as the "" Graves Registration Commission"" and was later renamed the "" Graves Registration Commission of the British Armies in France"".
In 1915, the Imperial War","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission . The new Graves Registration Commission had over 31 @,@ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50 @,@ 000 registered by May 1916 . "
" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","amplexus , a form of internal fertilization in which the male grasps the female around the waist with his forelimbs and clasps the female's cloaca with his tail. The male then inserts his cloaca into the female's cloaca and releases sperm into the female's reproductive tract. The female lays her eggs in a nest, and the male fertilizes the eggs as they are laid.
Temnospondyls are thought to have been oviparous, or egg-laying, amphibians.
Temnospondyls","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
