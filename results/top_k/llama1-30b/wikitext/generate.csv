" In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Copán , whose founder K 'inich Yax K 'uk","' Mo' was a vassal of Tikal.
The Maya civilization developed in an area in Central America that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatán Peninsula, and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain.
The Maya civilization","' Mo ' was clearly connected with Tikal . Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal . K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Copán in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan . Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as "" Lord of the West "" , much like Siyah K ’ ak ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries . "

Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French Général Henri @-@ Joseph Paixhans , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sinop , spelled the end of the wooden @-@ hulled warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot , which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power . "

The first cemetery to be opened was the Western Necropolis in 1832. The Eastern Necropolis was opened in 1846. The Southern Necropolis was opened in 1840.
The Western Necropolis was the first cemetery to be opened. It was opened in 1832. The cemetery was designed by David Hamilton. The cemetery was laid out in a grid pattern. The cemetery was divided into four sections","are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in perpetuity , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages .

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ulls upwards.

Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

" The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner backlot 's "" Blondie Street "" for the Burnham and Fitts ' homes .","The Burnham house was a two-story, 1920s-era Spanish Colonial Revival home with a red tile roof, white stucco walls, and a large front porch. The Fitts house was a two-story, 1920s-era Craftsman home with a red tile roof, white stucco walls, and a large front porch. The production also used the Warner backlot 's "" New York Street "" for the exterior of the Burnham home.
The production filmed scenes at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA","The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between Ricky and Jane 's bedroom windows , and between Ricky 's bedroom and Lester 's garage . The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. Fitts — watching from Ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex . Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the backlot , on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed . The inside of the Burnhams ' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the Fitts ' home was shot in the city 's Hancock Park neighborhood . Ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his "" monkish "" personality , while at the same time blending with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side . The production deliberately minimized the use of red , as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere . The Burnhams ' home uses cool blues , while the Fitts ' is kept in a "" depressed military palette "" . "

The Rhodesian operation 's other targets were Chikumbi , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of Lusaka , and Mkushi Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia . Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked . "

" Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge",". He was a great admirer of the work of the French painter Nicolas Poussin, and he was also influenced by the work of the Italian painter Giorgio de Chirico.
 Bacon's work is often described as ""figurative abstract art"", because many of his paintings are based on a human figure, but are re-interpreted in a very abstract way.
 Bacon's paintings are often violent and disturbing. He was a homosexual, and many of his paintings are of men in sexual situations. He was also a heavy drinker, and he often painted",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas "" in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . "" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . "" This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","himself in France. He was a member of the British Red Cross Commission, which had been sent to France to organise the evacuation of the British wounded from the battlefields. Ware was appalled by the lack of any official record of the burial places of those who had died in the war. He was determined to do something about it and, with the support of the British Red Cross, he set up the Graves Registration Commission in 1915.
In 1917 the Graves Registration Commission was absorbed into the British Army as the Directorate of Graves Registration and","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission .

" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","external fertilization , with the male and female coming together in the water to release sperm and eggs. The eggs were probably laid in water, and the larvae that hatched from them were aquatic. The larvae of some temnospondyls may have been able to leave the water and live on land for a short time, but they would have had to return to the water to reproduce.
The larvae of some temnospondyls may have been able to leave the water and live on land for a short time, but they would have had to return to the water to reproduce.","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
