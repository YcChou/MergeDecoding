The first troops to arrive were the men of No. 9 Platoon, D Company, who had been tasked with securing the bridge over the River Orne. They found that it was already securely held by the French Resistance.
The next day, Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway's 9th Parachute Battalion arrived and took command of the area. The following day, the rest of the battalion arrived, along with the 7th Parachute Battalion.
On 8 June, the","landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The Tetrarchs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "

Comment: I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is about English usage, not about English language.

Answer: The word ""however"" is used to introduce an idea that contrasts with what has been said before. In your example, you are saying that the storm was strong when it entered the channel, but then it became weaker. So you use ""however"" to say that something happened that contradicted what you just said.

" Temnospondyls ' vertebrae are divided into several segments .

The anterior centrum is made up of a pair of lateral masses that articulate with each other at their front ends. The posterior centrum is made up of a pair of neural spines that articulate with each other at their back ends.
In temnospondyls , the anterior centrum is usually much larger than the posterior centrum.

 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . W,"are's first attempt was in 1854 when he approached the City of London Corporation about acquiring a piece of waste ground on the edge of the city. The corporation agreed and the site, which had been used as a burial ground by St Botolph without Aldersgate from 1739 until 1852, was purchased for £600.
Ware then turned his attention to the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), which had been established in 1855 to provide public services such as water supply, sewers, street lighting and burial grounds in","are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in perpetuity , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government . "

Born in New York City, she was the daughter of an American father and a Russian mother. She studied piano with Leopold Godowsky and voice with Mathilde Marchesi. In 1895 she made her debut as a pianist at Carnegie Hall. She sang in opera from 1907 to 1914 and then devoted herself to recitals. She was one of the first singers to perform songs by Debussy, Ravel, and Stravinsky, and she introduced many new works by contemporary composers. She also wrote several books on music","historic occasion when she presented the works of George Gershwin , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert . The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time . She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold Schoenberg , Darius Milhaud , Béla Bartók , and Paul Hindemith . The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . She opened with Alexander 's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin , then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin : I 'll Build a Stairway to Paradise , Innocent Ingénue Baby , and Swanee . Gershwin played the piano for these pieces . Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann @-@ Heink , Virgil Thomson , and Paul Whiteman . Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art .

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ulls upwards.
Such a head shape is not seen in the fossil record until the Permian, when it was first adopted by the temnospondyls (see p. ). The temnospondyls were the most successful group of amphibians during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but they became extinct at the end of the Permian. It seems likely that the temnospondyls evolved this head shape to help them feed on fishes.
The temnospondyls had a very wide range of body shapes. Some were long and slender, like","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF,"'s capabilities.
Australia's involvement in East Timor was a watershed for Australia's military forces, which had been largely focused on the Asia–Pacific region since World War II. It also marked a turning point in Australia's relations with its neighbours, particularly Indonesia.
The decision to deploy troops to East Timor was made by the Howard Government in September 1999, following the resignation of President Habibie and the subsequent announcement that Indonesian armed forces would withdraw from East Timor. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) deployed a force of about","'s ability to conduct operations outside Australia .

" Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal – about 12 @,@ 000 – Kaw","aguchi
Japanese troops were not prepared for the ferocity of the American counterattack. The Japanese had underestimated the strength of the Allied forces on Guadalcanal and believed that they could easily overwhelm them. They also did not expect the Americans to be able to land so many men in one night.

" During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and","the Soviet Union, Australia would be drawn into the conflict. The country's geographical position meant that it was likely to become a battleground for the two superpowers, with the possibility of an invasion by either side or both.
Australia's strategic location also made it a potential target for nuclear attack. In the late 1940s, the United States began developing its first atomic weapons, and in 1952 the British government announced that it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. This development raised fears that the Soviets might follow suit. If they did, Australia could find","Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and RAN . "

NY 93 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a route extending from NY 17 in Westfield to NY 5 in Mayville. The portion of modern NY 93 between Westfield and Mayville was originally designated as part of NY 17. In the early 1940s, NY 93 was extended southwestward over what had been NY 17A to a junction with","907 or CR 907 ) in the center of the village of Youngstown . The route proceeds eastward through the village as a two @-@ lane road named Lockport Street , serving two blocks of commercial areas before bending to the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of Youngstown . At the eastern village limits , NY 93 briefly widens to four lanes as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Niagara Scenic Parkway . Past the junction , the highway reverts to a two @-@ lane road and changes names to Youngstown – Lockport Road as it runs across the town of Porter . The residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of Towers Corners , where NY 93 connects to NY 18 ( Creek Road ) . "

In 1904, the Japanese attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur (now called Lushun) on the southern tip of Manchuria . This was the first major battle of the Russo-Japanese War.
The Japanese won the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905, which led to the Treaty of Portsmouth that ended the war.
The treaty gave Japan control over Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin Island, as well as the right to build a railway","States , and Japan — soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests . In June , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China .

The force dispatched was a modest one , with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria , 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector , under the command of Captain William Creswell . Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists , who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role . Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks , Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War .

 At the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the Welsh team due to fans of both Swansea and Llanel,"li being present, but as the game progressed they became more friendly.
The first half was a very scrappy affair with neither side able to get any rhythm going. The only real chance of note came in the 15th minute when a long ball from the back found its way through to John Toshack who ran at the defence before unleashing a shot that went just wide of the post.

Swords also noted that the limestone used at Fort Scott was not as good as the stone used at Fort Leavenworth . He said that ""the stone here is much harder than that at Leavenworth, and consequently more difficult to work.""

 A number of merchant ships had gathered at Bombay in the spring of 1797 in preparation for the trip to Macau to load,"tea. The _William_ , a ship of 350 tons, was one of them. She was owned by the East India Company and commanded by Captain John Hackman.
Captain Hackman was an experienced seaman who had been with the company since 1782. He had served on many voyages between England and India, and he knew his way around the Indian Ocean. But this time he would be sailing into uncharted waters.

 La Venta Monument 3 stands 1 @.@ 98 metres ( 6 @.@ 5 ft ) high and measures 1 @,".@ 20 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) across.
Apart from the fact that it is a very large stone sculpture, there are no other details about this monument. It is not known what it represents or who made it. The only thing we know for certain is that it was carved out of a single block of basalt.
The basalt used to make the monument came from a quarry located in the nearby village of El Trapiche. This quarry has been worked since pre-Columbian times. The basalt used to make the monument is dark grey with flecks",".@ 6 metres ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) wide by 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) deep ; it weighs 12 @.@ 8 tons . Monument 3 was located a few metres to the east of Monument 2 , but was moved to the Parque @-@ Museo La Venta in Villahermosa . Like the other La Venta heads , its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weathering , making analysis difficult . It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion . Straps descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument . The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps ; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region . Although most of the facial detail is lost , the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident , a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads . "
 Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to,"remove large chunks of stone. The sculptors then used abrasive tools such as sandstone and quartzite to smooth out the surface, and finally polished the finished product with a soft stone called _chert_.
##### **The Colossal Heads**
The colossal heads are the most famous of all Olmec artworks. They are also among the oldest surviving examples of monumental sculpture in Mesoamerica. The largest of these is the head from La Venta, which measures 3 meters (9 feet) high and weighs about 40 tons. It","chip away both large and small flakes of stone . The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones , which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed . "

Operation Gatling , launched on 19 October 1978 , was another joint @-@ force operation between the Air Force and the Army , which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers . Gatling 's primary target , just 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) north @-@ east of central Lusaka , was the formerly white @-@ owned Westlands Farm , which had been transformed into ZIPRA 's main headquarters and training base under the name "" Freedom Camp "" . ZIPRA presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka . About 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp , with senior ZIPRA staff also on site . The Rhodesian operation 's other targets were Chikumbi , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of Lusaka , and Mkushi Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia . Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked . "
 Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following,"a naval bombardment on 19 February 1915, landed troops on the peninsula. The Turkish defenders were able to withstand the invasion and after eight months of fighting the Allies evacuated their forces in December 1915.
Turkish casualties were estimated as 250,000 killed or wounded, while the Allies lost 430,000 men. The campaign was one of the greatest Ottoman victories during the war and is considered a major failure of the Allied military planning. It has been described as the","a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British , Indian and French forces committed to the campaign . The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) — commanded by British general William Birdwood — subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915 . Although promising to transform the war if successful , the Gallipoli Campaign was ill @-@ conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives . Australian casualties totalled 26 @,@ 111 , including 8 @,@ 141 killed . "
" Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge",".
.
Bacon's paintings are characterized by the use of bold, primary colors applied in thick impasto with a palette knife. His preferred subjects were the human figure, animals, and heads. He used broad areas of flat color punctuated by white to create abstract shapes and forms. The resulting canvases appear at once realistic and grotesque.
.
In 1946, Bacon began painting portraits of friends and acquaintances from memory. These works were inspired by Velázquez's _Las Meninas_ (1656), which",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas "" in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . "" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . "" This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","himself in France with a group of British reservists. He was appalled by the lack of care for wounded soldiers and decided to form an organisation to provide comforts for the troops.
On 17 October 1914, he established the Friends Ambulance Unit (FAU) which provided medical assistance on the Western Front . The FAU was staffed by volunteers from Britain and America who were trained as ambulance drivers and stretcher-bearers. They worked under fire at the front line, often exposed to enemy shelling and shrapnel.
In 191","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission . The new Graves Registration Commission had over 31 @,@ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50 @,@ 000 registered by May 1916 . "
" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","a process called internal fertilization, where the male deposits sperm into the female's body and she lays eggs. However, some temnospondyls may have had external fertilization, where the male releases sperm directly into the water and the female picks up the sperm with her cloaca (the opening at the end of her body).
Temnospondyls were also unique among amphibians because they laid their eggs on land. The eggs would hatch into tadpoles that lived in freshwater ponds or lakes for several years before metamorphosing into adult","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
