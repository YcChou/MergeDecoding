"On Monday, the Israeli army withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Palestinians rejoiced over this occasion, with Mahmoud Abb","as declaring that it was a ""victory for the Palestinian people.""
Abbas's statement is not surprising. The withdrawal of the Israelis from Gaza has been presented as a victory for the Palestinians by many in the Arab world and beyond. But what does this mean? What exactly did the Israelis leave behind?
The answer to this question is simple: they left behind a terrorist state.
In 2005, Israel unilaterally disengaged from Gaza. It removed all its settlements and military bases from the area, leaving behind only some green","as saying that ""This is a day of happiness and joy that the Palestinian people have not witnessed for a century.""

The 38 years of Israeli presence in the Gaza strip have officially ended.

Palestinians were overjoyed at the sight of the burning synagogues, planting flags in the midst of it all, and shouting cries of independence. Teenagers set fire to a few synagogues, letting out anger at Israel's occupation.

The fires did little damage to the concrete structures, but Abbas said that the Palestinians planned to destroy them fully.

Palestinian police admitted that there was not much they could or would do to stop this.

Last year, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy the synagogues, but this Sunday, under pressure from religious Jewish organizations, it reversed its decision. Palestinians were angry at the cabinet's Sunday vote.

The synagogues, as well as all community structures, including community centers, schools, and sports facilites, are the only physical remnants of the Israeli Gaza Strip presence since all residential structures have been destroyed."

Bettman said that he was ""disappointed"" with the decision but that it was necessary to protect the long-term health and stability of the league.
The cancellation comes after a week of negotiations between the players' union and the owners failed to produce an agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement. The current CBA expires at midnight tonight.
The NHLPA had offered a deal that would have reduced the salary cap from $39 million to $37 million for next season and then to $34 million in 20","has been canceled. The announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days. The dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players. The majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount. The club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million. Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said ""The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.""

This will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded. That year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off."
"German news magazine Der Spiegel reported today that a letter from an extremist Islamic organization calling itself ""Secret Organisation Group of Al-Qaeda of","Jihad in Europe"" was found on the body of one of the suicide bombers who attacked London's transport system last week.
According to the report, the letter was written by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of the terror group al-Tawhid wal-Jihad and is addressed to Osama bin Laden. The letter was sent to Zarqawi by courier from Iraq.
The letter calls for attacks against Britain and the United States, and also urges Muslims to attack Jews and Christians.

Nation of Islam and Arab nation: Rejoice for it is time to take revenge against the British Zionist Crusader government in retaliation for the massacres Britain is committing in Iraq and Afghanistan. The heroic mujahideen have carried out a blessed raid in London. Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters.

We have repeatedly warned the British Government and people. We have fulfilled our promise and carried out our blessed military raid in Britain after our mujahideen exerted strenuous efforts over a long period of time to ensure the success of the raid.

We continue to warn the governments of Denmark and Italy and all the Crusader governments that they will be punished in the same way if they do not withdraw their troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. He who warns is excused.

Molson Canada picks up Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. as the company maneuvers to make an entry into the craft beer,"market.
Creemore Springs, which is based in Ontario, has been brewing since 1987 and produces a variety of ales including lager, pale ale, porter, stout and wheat beers. The company also makes cider.
Molson said it will continue to operate Creemore Springs as a stand-alone business with its current management team.

Creemore Springs of Creemore, Ontario, produces the locally popular Creemore Springs lager. The merger will allow the company to retain its identity.

""The Creemore brand image and brewing craft will remain unchanged,"" Creemore Springs Brewery chairman Bill Wilder said. ""Molson understands and appreciates what is special about the Creemore brand and this makes them a great purchaser for the company.""

Industry observers are mixed on the benefits of the deal for Molson. The CBC reports one analyst suggests Molson may be trying to replicate the success of rival Labatt's premium beers. Others point out the small brewery model does not scale up well, and the attraction of a ""boutique"" beer fades in large-scale production.

The World Health Organisation has announced that the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatments (ART) in developing countries is increasing significantly - more,"than 1.4 million people are now on ART, compared to just 500,000 at the end of 2006.
In a report published today, UNAIDS said that this increase was due to an expansion of treatment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.
The report also found that there were 33.4 million people living with HIV worldwide by the end of 2007, up from 32.9 million in 2006.
However, it added that the rate of new infections had","than doubling between December 2003 and June 2005. One million people are now getting the drugs they need, compared to just 400,000 eighteen months ago.

However, access to treatment is not growing as fast as demand, and the UN is unlikely to reach its target of treating three million people by the end of 2005 - just over half the people who need it. The longer-term target of universal treatment by 2010 is still likely to be met.

The figures show that the number of people receiving ART is increasing in every part of the globe, but not as quickly as people are contracting HIV. The numbers getting treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, the part of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS has increased threefold on a year ago, and doubled in the last six months. The same rate of growth as also been seen in Asia, the second-worst affected area.

The WHO's report highlights that the best progress has been made when governments have worked together with the WHO, the UN and other parterners. The report goes on to make recommendations for simplifying the process to enable treatment levels to be increased even faster.

The UN's target was based on what was hypothetically possible if all possible steps to provide treatment were taken. The report shows the while financial, political and technical steps have been made, other areas are falling short.

Pressure groups said that countries were reacting too slowly to the pandemic and called on the G8 to provide more sustainable funding for universal treatment for Aids.

UK international development minister Gareth Thompson said: ""We are committed to universal access to HIV treatments by 2010. We will spend £1.5bn in the next three years on Aids, including £150m on orphans."""
A recent survey conducted by the American Cancer Society has turned up some surprising results: Americans generally hold false beliefs about the nature of cancer and its treatment,".
While 80 percent of respondents said they were confident in their knowledge of cancer, only 39 percent could correctly identify all three major symptoms of colon cancer (blood in the stool, a change in bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss). And while 75 percent of respondents knew that smoking causes lung cancer, only 42 percent knew that it also increases the risk for other cancers, including bladder, kidney, cervical, pancreatic, and oral cancers.
The survey also found that many people believe that cancer",", even though many believe they are well informed.

Health experts say this ignorance could be dangerous: People may be making poor health decisions -- avoiding cancer screenings or rejecting potentially life-saving treatments -- based on their incorrect notions.

The most common misconception is that surgery causes cancer to spread. Decades ago, cancer often was not discovered until it was very advanced. At that stage, surgical efforts were rarely successful, and many patients died soon after procedures were performed. This may have given rise to the mistaken belief that the surgeries caused the disease to worsen.

Another commonly held myth is that there is a cure for cancer, but the medical industry is withholding it in order to continue profiting from the sale of less effective treatments and medications.

Believers in this ""conspiracy theory"" may not be guided by it in making their personal health decisions, though. The American Cancer Society says that even though many people are suspicious of the medical industry in general, they have a trusting relationship with their own physicians and are likely to follow their advice.

Almost 20 percent of the people surveyed felt that medications for cancer pain were ineffective.

About 10 percent expressed the belief that cancer could be cured with a positive attitude alone, while a similar number felt that there was no effective treatment for cancer.

The fact is, cancer survival and treatments -- including pain management -- have vastly improved in the last thirty years.

Results of the survey appear in the August 1 issue of Cancer, a journal published by the American Cancer Society."

Blair sais also that the Kyoto Protocol doesn't go far enough.

Brazil is threatening to break the patent of US-based Abbott Laboratories as it pushes ahead with its programme to supply its people with,"cheap generic drugs.
Brazil's health ministry has asked a federal court to invalidate the patent on Kaletra, an antiretroviral drug used in treating Aids patients. The move comes after Abbott refused to license the drug to Brazil at a price that would make it affordable for the country's poor.
The company said it was disappointed by the decision and would appeal against it.
""We are very concerned about the impact this could have on our ability to continue to provide medicines to millions of Brazilians,"" said John Capek, president of","free AIDS drugs.

Brazil has given Abbott a deadline of July 7 to cut the prices of its drug Kaletra or a Brazilian company will begin cloning it. This move would test recent World Trade Organization concessions allowing poor countries to produce generic drugs for local health emergencies.

Abbott has said that Brazil's demand goes ""against the spirit"" of the WTO agreement, since it has the ninth largest economy in the world, and that this could damage future research for improved treatments.

Previous programmes have been negotiated between companies and governments to produce generic versions of AIDS drugs, but this is the first time a country has threatened to use powers negotiated at the WTO by producing the drug without the cooperation of the patent holder.

Several campaign groups are supporting the move, hoping that other developing countries will be able to take the lead of Brazil and produce generic drugs for their own populations. Michael Bailey, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam International, said: ""The impact of breaking the patent would be enormous. If a major country such as Brazil goes through with this, not only will it help ensure sustainability of their excellent treatment programme, it will set a hugely important precedent for other countries.""

The US Chamber of Commerce has issued a statement urging Brazil to reconsider and suggesting that the move could create a rift between the countries. Thomas Donohue, Chamber President and CEO said: ""Brazil’s threat to strip patent rights from a U.S. company should concern all investors and every business around the world because of the precedent it sets for the treatment of intellectual property."""
Millions of origami cranes have been dropped on Thailand's three southern provinces following violence between the government and ethnic minority Muslim populations,".
A group called ""The Crane Project"" has been dropping the paper birds in an effort to promote peace.
The project was started by a 20-year-old student, who said he wanted to help bring peace to the region.
He told the BBC that he had received more than 10 million cranes from people around the world.
The cranes were being dropped over the weekend in Pattani, Narathiwat and Yala - the three provinces where most of the violence has taken place.
The project is named after Sadako Sasaki, a Japanese",". The move has been called a ""goodwill gesture"" towards Muslims.

Up to 120 million such paper sculptures were dropped on Thailand's three southern-most provinces, Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. Tensions in this area have increased recently, peaking with the recent death of 85 demonstrators arrested during a protest. The government blamed their deaths on physical weakness due to fasting in the month of Ramadan as the cause, as most if not all the deaths occurred during transport of up to 500 arrested protestors. Critics of the Thai government have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, blaming the ""over-eagerness"" of Thai security forces as the cause of the deaths.

The dispersal was timed to coincide with the birthday of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and has generated much interest from the rest of the country's predominantly Buddhist population.
The cranes were built by citizens throughout Thailand and had peace messages written on them. The southern, Muslim provinces are often considered neglected by a north that is larger and of the majority ethnic group. Some have welcomed the goodwill gesture, but critics in both the north and south have said that the resources would have been better spent solving the problems in the south. Some Islamic leaders in the south have also expressed concerns that the gesture may not be properly understood by Muslims, as the crane carries no cultural significance with them."
"In the wake of a United States Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. New London on eminent domain last week, a California man has proposed","that the city of San Francisco use its power to take his home and give it to Google.
Mike Montgomery, who lives in a 1906 Victorian house in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, is offering to sell his property for $2 million to the Internet search giant. He says he'll donate the proceeds to charity.
""I think this would be a great way to help out the community,"" said Montgomery, who works as an architectural designer. ""It's a win-win situation.""
Montgomery said he was inspired by the court","that Justice David Souter's New Hampshire home be seized by the state and a hotel be built on the site. Logan Darrow Clements faxed a letter to town officials in Weare, New Hampshire June 28, 2005 that justified the action as such:

""The justification for such an eminent domain action is that our hotel will better serve the public interest as it will bring in economic development and higher tax revenue to Weare.""

Justice Souter, who was in the majority ruling in the Kelo case, has lived at the farmhouse in Weare since he was 11 years old. Clements indicated that it was necessary to build on that location because ""it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans."" The action has given rise to a great deal of support nationwide, as many are writing to the councilors of the small town of Weare to voice their approval for the proposal.

The proposal for the ""Lost Liberty Hotel"", as it is to be called, features a number of components which seem to focus on the libertarian leanings of its designer. A dining room, called the ""Just Desserts Cafe"" and a museum based on the ""loss of freedom in America"" are two such components. Instead of a Bible provided by the Gideons (a standard item placed in most American hotel rooms), each guest will receive a free copy of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged."
People all over the Netherlands are voting today in a referendum on the EU constitution. This the first national referendum for two hundred years and it is non,"-binding, so the government can ignore the result if they want to.
The Dutch have been very vocal about their opposition to the constitution, with many people saying that they will vote no. The main reason for this is that the Dutch feel that the constitution does not do enough to protect their interests.
I think that the Dutch are right to be concerned about the constitution. It is a bad document which has been rushed through without proper debate or consideration of the issues involved. I am also worried about the way that the European Union is developing into an undemocratic superstate.
However, I don't think","-binding. Though most major political parties have stated they will abide by the referendum if the outcome is sufficiently clear and a large enough percentage of the voters have actually voted.
The question put to voters will be:

:Bent U voor of tegen instemming door Nederland met het verdrag tot vaststelling van een grondwet voor Europa?
:""Are you for or against approval by the Netherlands of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe?""

All the main political parties have asked for a voor (for, or yes) vote. However polls have been saying that two-thirds of the people will be voting tegen (against, or no).

One reason for people to vote no is the expansion of the European Union with large countries like Turkey, which they fear will cause less influence for the smaller countries. The view of an European super state in which the Netherlands would loose its own identity is another reason for voting no. Some of the no voters do this to show they don't agree with the current political situation and the supposed risen prices since the introduction of the euro.

As of 14:00 CET, 9% more voters had turned up for the referendum than for the European elections.

In addition, Aldouri said that the new constitution will be completed by August 15th.",", Samir Sumaidaie, declared to reporters that the international body of the United Nations helped the regime of Saddam Hussein. This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's Oil-for-Food program with Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali although there is no charge against him in the report.

In an interview with Voice of America reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie said: ""In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later.... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program.""

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.

After being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said: ""Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him.""

On Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: ""We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it."""
"Bitmover, the company producing a management program for computer source code named Bitkeeper (BK), announced on April 5 that it will no longer","offer its software to open-source developers.
Bitkeeper is used by many open-source projects, including the Linux kernel and the GNOME desktop environment. The announcement came as a shock to many in the open-source community, who had been using BK without charge since 2001.
The decision was made after an internal review of the company's business model, according to Bitmover CEO Larry McVoy. ""We have decided that we can no longer afford to give away our product,"" he said.
McVoy said that the company would continue to support existing customers until their","be providing a free version of its product.

As a result of Bitmover's announcement, the programmer who wrote the original Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds, stated on a mailing list that he ""decided to not use BK mainly because he needs to figure out the alternatives"". As to an alternative to Bitkeeper, Torvalds hinted that he is considering Monotone but that Subversion, a recent replacement for CVS, is out of the running. Bitkeeper was originally developed to allow Torvalds to manage code contributions more easily, according to Jeremy Andrews at Kerneltrap.org, and was previously provided to kernel developers free of charge, though it was restricted in its use.

Bitkeeper is the software that Torvalds and hundreds of other Linux developers use to manage submissions of code to the Linux kernel, the heart of the computer operating systems referred to as ""Linux"" or ""GNU/Linux"". Linux is distributed in many different forms, bundled with other software by companies such as Red Hat, Novell, and Linspire.

While the details are not clear, it appears from Andrews' article that Bitmover's decision to stop releasing the free version of Bitkeeper is related to a dispute with Torvalds' employer, Open Source Development Labs (OSDL).

According to Kerneltrap, an OSDL contractor had been reverse engineering the free version of Bitkeeper in order to make an open source replacement, which is prohibited by the license under which the free version of Bitkeeper is released. Nevertheless, Torvalds notes in his post that he is ""personally very happy with BK, and with Larry McVoy, the CEO of Bitmover."""

""This is a significant contribution from the Commonwealth,"" said Prime Minister Julia Gillard. ""It's an important part of our national response to this terrible tragedy.""
The federal government had previously pledged A$1","to approximately 600 former RAAF maintenance workers, who where exposed to highly toxic chemicals while working on the fuel tanks of the nation's F-111 fleet.

Under the government's proposal, depending on the amount of exposure, a worker can expect to receive between A$10,000 and A$40,000 (US $7,500 - $30,000) to help cope with the side effects. The aircraft maintenance program started in the 1970s and was suspended in the late 1990s when the former workers started to show signs of medical problems ranging from memory loss to neurological problems.

The F-111 Deseal/Reseal Support Group responded to the government's package with anger. The Group's president Ian Fraser said ""A$40,000 for a ruined life is simply not enough ... We've already got people who have died, who are dying, people who have lost their homes.""

The fifth and final Test started on 8 September at the Oval in London. It entered its final day evenly balanced with all results still possible and the destination of the urn still in doubt. Australia needed to win to force a 2-2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give them to England, ending 18 years and eight series of Australian dominance. In the end, England managed to bat out the final day, and a draw ensured the Ashes were coming back to England.

Kevin Pietersen and Ashley Giles hit personal bests of 158 and 59 respectively, to bat out the best part of the last day. Pieterson's 158 was his maiden test century, and included 7 sixes. Early in the day, Australia looked to be in with a chance of winning the match, with early wickets leaving England at 67 for 3. Giles and Pietersen's century partnership, though, left Australia with no hope of catching England in the remains of the day, sealing England's Ashes win since 1987.

England's next Tests will be an away series in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the world champions Australia will play an ICC World XI (which inclues Kevin Pietersen, Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff) in the Johnnie Walker Super Series in early October."
Space.com reported yesterday on a picture of a planet taken by the Very Large Telescope located in Chile. The European Southern Observatory's,"telescope took a picture of a planet orbiting a star 120 light years away from Earth.
The planet is called Fomalhaut b and it orbits a star named Fomalhaut, which is about 25 times brighter than our sun. The planet was discovered in 2008 but this is the first time that astronomers have been able to take a picture of it.
Fomalhaut b is about three times bigger than Jupiter and it takes 872 years to complete one orbit around its star. It is also very cold with temperatures reaching","telescope, which was used to capture the picture, has made the first confirmed discovery of a planet orbiting another star.

Scientists have been trying to locate planets outside our own solar system for nearly 10 years. Inferences of nearly 150 planets in other solar systems have been observed so far by using instruments and measurements that only suggest the existence of another planet. Until now, no planet has been confirmed by the means of a photographed image. There was, months earlier, another team of scientists who took pictures of what might be another planet, but that image remains controversial because it shows what may be an even more distant object instead.

The research team that photographed the planet with its host star was led by Ralph Neuhaeuser of the Astrophysical Institute &amp; University Observatory (AIU). ""The detection of the faint object near the bright star is certain,"" he told Space.com on Friday.

The new image contains the star, GQ Lupi, with an orbiting planet. It is smaller than our sun, 70% the size, and is located 400 light-years away from our solar system. The planet is nearly twice the size of Jupiter. Unlike our sun which is 4.6 billion years old, the GQ Lupi star is approximately 1 million years old and is considered very young for a star. The planet orbiting GQ Lupi is three times further out than Neptune's orbit around our sun, and scientists estimate the orbiting period to be about 1,200 years. The planets wide orbiting distance from the GQ Lupi was an important element for enabling the photograph to be taken.

The planet, much like the star it orbits, is very hot &amp;mdash; about 2,000 degrees Kelvin &amp;mdash; so despite the detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, which at that temperature would make it gaseous, there is no expectation it might support life.

The discovery will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics."
"Young Quakers who planned to take part in the World Gathering of Young Friends at Lancaster University, England have been unable to attend after having","their visas refused.
A group of 10 young people from Ireland and Northern Ireland had hoped to travel to the gathering which is taking place this weekend (23-25 August).
The group were planning to travel by ferry from Belfast to Liverpool on Friday 23 August but were told that they would not be allowed into the UK because they did not have a valid passport.
The group had applied for visas through the British Embassy in Dublin but were told that they needed to apply through the embassy in Belfast. However, the group was told that it","their visas denied.

Their absence has been a cause of ""hurt"" at the meetings. Sara Wolcott of Pacific Yearly Meeting on the Western coast of America wrote in a journal on the WGYF website: ""I saw in a workshop for Friends planning to meet in Kenya how much the absence of so many Friends was felt; the gathering felt incomplete. We desperately wanted our brothers and sisters to be with us, I know they wanted to be here too.""

Most of the denials were for economic reasons, if someone doesn't have a high enough income or a fixed job it can be assumed that they will stay in the country for work. Representatives from the gathering now plan to go to Kenya in October to share some of the programme with those who were unable to come.

Despite the missing Friends, the gathering has brought together a mix of different Quaker traditions in a positive atmosphere that has been appreciated by participants. Many Quakers worship in silence (unprogrammed meetings) while others, particularly in America and Africa, have ministers like other churches. Quakers also have differences of opinion over theological issues, including even the existence of God, but the young Friends have not found this to be an obstacle to coming together. Unlike many traditional Christian sects, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, encourage each member to explore his or her own relationship with God.

Chrissy Muhr of Northwest Yearly Meeting (Northwest US) wrote: ""I've been really impressed by how the mix of worship styles has been handled. Almost all the programmed Friends I've spoken to have some prior experience of unprogrammed worship. For me, the hardest thing has been not falling asleep during long periods of silence - the long week has begun to take its toll."""
A new redesigned US $10 bill was introduced at a ceremony yesterday on Ellis Island. The new bill adds three new background colors; red,", orange and yellow to the existing green color.
The new design is intended to make it easier for blind people to distinguish between denominations of bills. It also includes a tactile feature that will help blind people identify each denomination.
The new design features a portrait of Alexander Hamilton on the front of the note and an image of the Treasury Department building on the back.
The new notes are expected to be in circulation by 2020.",", yellow and orange. It continues to feature Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. The $10 bill is the third US bill to switch from the traditional green. The $20 and $50 bills were redesigned to feature color within the past two years.

The improvements in digital technology have made it much easier for counterfeiters. ""Ten years ago, 1 percent of (counterfeit) bills were produced on digital equipment. These days, 56 percent are produced on digital equipment, and the technology is more accessible to the general population,"" said Eric Zahren, spokesman for the Secret Service.

According to the Treasury Department, to be able to keep ahead of counterfeiters currency will need to continue to be updated every seven to ten years. The $10 bill was last redesigned in 2000. ""The intention was not to create a counterfeit-proof note&amp;mdash;which is basically impossible&amp;mdash;but one that's harder to duplicate and easier to authenticate,"" said Zahren. This new bill includes many new and enhanced security features such as color-shifting ink, a watermark, microprinting and a security thread

Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said in a statement ""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. Government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure."" The new $10 bill is expected to go into circulation in early 2006."

"House Democrats called for an investigation into possible voting fraud and irregularities during the 2004 U.S. presidential election, according","to a letter sent by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) to the Justice Department on Thursday.
Conyers, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said he was concerned about reports of voter intimidation and other problems in Ohio, Florida and elsewhere. He asked Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to investigate whether any laws were broken.
""The integrity of our electoral system is fundamental to our democracy,"" Conyers wrote. ""It is imperative that we ensure that every eligible American has the opportunity to vote and have his or her vote counted.""","to a Dec. 23 letter from House Representative David Wu (D-OR).

Thousands of Ohio citizens have reported experiencing problems casting their votes due to long lines at polling places, malfunctioning voting machines, inexplicable numbers of votes cast, and disenfranchisement in urban areas.

""The integrity of our democracy is at stake. We need to give the American people confidence that each and every vote will be properly counted and that the democratic electoral process is respected,"" Wu said. ""I also understand concerns about the conflict of interest of having an official in charge of running elections in a key state also heading a presidential campaign. I agree that Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell's dual role calls into question any election decision he made that favored Republicans.""

Other Congressmen including John Conyers (D-MI), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and Robert Wexler (D-FL) voiced similar concerns, and requested an investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), citing specific cases in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, and California.

In December, Conyers, the Ranking Democrat on the House Committee on the Judiciary, issued a series of letters about voting irregularities to the media, campaign officials, and manufacturers of voting equipment. These letters seek to collect and preserve information regarding the conduct of the election.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office previously reported on voting irregularities in eariler presidential elections.

A September 14, 2004 GAO report on the 2000 presidential elections detailed changes the DOJ implemented to try to ensure voter access to polls, and the importance of monitoring election-day activities. The report warned that allegations in the 2000 election lacked sufficient specifics to enable the DOJ to perform and adequate investigation and recommended that more precise information be collected regarding voting for the 2004 presidential election."
"Missing American teen Natalee Holloway, who vanished on the Dutch island of Aruba two weeks ago, is feared to be","dead.
Investigators have found no trace of her since she disappeared after a night out with friends and are now treating the case as a murder investigation.
The 18-year-old from Alabama was last seen leaving a bar in the early hours of May 30 with Joran Van der Sloot, the son of a prominent judge on the island.
He has been arrested twice but released both times for lack of evidence.
Police said they had found blood in his car and that he had admitted taking Ms Holloway to his home.
But he later retracted his conf","dead today following a suspect's statement earlier this morning. The suspect, who is yet to be named, told police that ""something bad happened"" to the missing teen. Police Commissioner District 1 Gerold Dompig said that the suspect was leading police to a scene, where it is believed a major update to the case is to be found.

Two security guards were taken into police custody early last week: 28-year-old Abraham Jones and 30-year-old Mickey John. Additionally, three teenagers who were believed to be the last people to have seen Halloway are now under custody. Among the three teenagers is 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe, 21-year-old Depak Kalpoe, and 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, a friend of the brothers and son to a Judicial Servant.

Anita van der Sloot, mother of suspect Joran van der Sloot, told American news network CNN that her son stated to her that he was ""innocent"", and even offered to speak to Holloway's family. No announcement from police has yet confirmed the death of Holloway."
"A Romanian student officer on mission in Iraq, Major Robertino Ciobanu, was wounded on Sunday by a bullet fired unintentionally","by an American soldier.
Major Ciobanu is the first Romanian military casualty in Iraq. He was hit by a bullet while he was supervising the training of Iraqi soldiers at a shooting range near Baghdad. The bullet came from a US soldier who was firing his weapon and did not notice that there were other people around him.
The Romanian officer was taken to a hospital in Baghdad where he underwent surgery for a wound in the abdomen. His condition is stable but he will remain in hospital for several days.

The officer's colleague accidentally fired on him while unloading weapons, a standard procedure for military personnel when they are returning from patrol missions. Ciobanu was wounded in the leg, but after being treated at hospital, he was declared out of danger.

Major Ciobanu is currently involved in training new Iraqi security personnel. Romania has one of the largest contingents in Iraq, with 830 soldiers. At the end of March, three Romanian journalists were kidnapped in Iraq, with the kidnappers later demanding that Romania pull its troops out of the country or else the journalists would be killed."

Representatives of both the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) signed a peace pledge today in the,"Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
The agreement was witnessed by representatives from the United States, Britain, Norway, France, Germany, Italy, Egypt, Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, South Africa, Nigeria, Chad, Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Turkey","Kenyan capital Nairobi, under the watchful eye of United Nations ambassadors.

According to the BBC, the document concluded with a memorandum saying that ""prompt completion of the peace process is essential for all the people of Sudan"". The actual peace treaty should, according to the pledge, be signed no later than December 31st 2004. While the pledge focuses mainly on the fights between the rebels in the south and the Khartoum-based government in the north, there is also attention for the ongoing crisis in east Sudan (Darfur).

Several aid agencies have criticized the UN for taking a weak stand against the Sudanese government. The Security Council has already signed two resolutions threatening economic sanctions against Sudan if the government does not disarm its troops in Darfur, but, so the BBC reports, the violence is continuing. The civil war in Darfur was sparked in 2003, when insurgents started attacking government buildings. The Arab government in Khartoum subsequently sent troops to the region, which have been reported to mass-violate human rights of the black Africans living in Darfur."
"In anticipation of a Security Council vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the International Criminal Court, Sudan announced today it would reject","any such move.
Sudanese Foreign Minister Lam Akol said his country would not accept an ICC referral for crimes in Darfur and that he was ""not optimistic"" about the outcome of the council's vote.
The United States has been pushing for a resolution to send the case to The Hague, but China and Russia have expressed reservations.
A draft resolution circulated by Britain and France calls for the U.N. Security Council to refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands.
The resolution also calls for the deployment","any United Nations resolution that required war crimes suspects to be tried abroad. The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the French delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week.

Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, ""Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese &amp;mdash; whether he is a rebel or government official &amp;mdash; outside the Sudan: we are totally against it."" In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group ""Justice and Equality of Movement,"" said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace.

Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to human rights abuses in Darfur. Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts.

The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias. It has often been suggested that this qualifies as genocide, and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights."

James Byrd was dragged to death behind a pickup truck in Jasper, Texas, on June 7, 1998. The three men convicted of his murder were sentenced to death.
The tape is from an interview with John William King, who was convicted of killing Byrd and sentenced to death. He was executed in April 2019.
King told investigators that he had been drinking heavily when he saw Byrd walking down the road. He said he offered him a ride, but Byrd refused.
""","of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford. On the tape, John E. Couey is heard admitting to molesting a young girl in her own backyard. For the crime he was subsequently charged, convicted and imprisoned for 2 years.

An accompanying written report by the officer who took the taped confession says; ""Couey admitted that this was not the first child he had ever touched, however, this is the first time he was caught."" The officer continues, ""Couey admitted to molesting his wife's daughter, however, she agreed not to report the incident if he left the house and gave her a divorce, which he did."" CNN was unable to locate Couey's former wife.

The revelation calls into question the way Couey has been dealt with by officials over the years. He spoke on the 1991 tape about how he ""needs help"" and ""wants help"".

Mary Doyle, a Citrus County probation official, said Monday that if they had known Couey was a registered sex offender, they may have been able to keep him away from Jessica Lunsford. Florida Courts do not provide probation workers with criminal backgrounds of their probationers, even in the case of registered sexual offenders like Couey, Doyle said. With that information they might have tried harder to locate him when he failed to report in with probation officials last November. When detectives did finally catch up with him, they learned he had been living across the road from Jessica."

"The Senator Julian McGauran in the Australian Senate had made an ""unseemly"" gesture across the floor of the Senate whilst it was in session",".
Senator McGauran, who is a member of the Liberal Party, was speaking on the issue of same-sex marriage and he was making a point by holding up his hand with his fingers spread out to represent the number 10.
The motion before the Senate at that time was to allow a vote on whether or not to have a conscience vote on the issue of same-sex marriage.
The motion was lost by 38 votes to 26.
Senator McGauran's action was seen as being disrespectful to the President of the Senate, Senator John Hogg","on August 11, apparently as a result of interjections about a division taking place.

Whilst this was not immediately debated, Senator Bob Brown had asked the Acting Deputy President of the Senate to look into the matter. Later the President of the Senate ruled that the gesture was ""unseemly but not obscene"".

This ruling caused a fierce debate, with Senator Brown saying that McGauran's ""arrogant and disgusting"" actions exemplified the Government's attitude towards its new-found Senate majority, whilst Senator Ron Boswell, the National Party Senate leader, had criticised Brown of hypocrisy, stating that Brown had ""broken every law in Australia"" and ""every law in Tasmania"" (which Bartlett noted as a point of order as being hyperbole).

Senator McGauran then spoke, stating that he ""regretted his actions"". Brown however noted that this was not an unqualified apology. A motion was then put that the President's ruling be dissented from, which debate was set for another sitting. Senator Chris Evans, the Labor Senate leader and Senator Brown had called for McGauran's sacking as Chief Government whip; his National Party superiors have said that they will speak to McGauran about the incident."

But this isn’t true. Even if you’ve been bitten by a dog or cat, you need to seek medical attention immediately. If you wait too long, you could be putting your life at risk.
Rabies is a virus that affects the brain and nerv","last week a teenage girl named Jeanna Giese was released from a hospital having been successfuly treated. She became the first known person to recover from the disease without vaccination.

On September 12, 2004, Jeanna &amp;mdash; a 15 year old from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin&amp;mdash; was bitten by a bat while attending church. By the time she saw a doctor about fatigue and numbness, it was October 18, and the bat incident was not brought up until several days later. Usually when there is a possibility of rabies, doctors will vaccinate patients: the vaccine has a chance to act before the symptoms appear. In Jeanna's case it was too late to try to vaccinate, and her doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin devised a new treatment. Jeanna was put into a drug-induced coma for a week, and doctors began an intensive treatment to prop up her nervous system until her natural immunity recovered enough to fight the disease.

By surviving and recovering, Jeanna became the only person known in medicine to overcome rabies without a vaccine. She is not yet fully recovered: the effects of the coma are still apparent, and she has difficulty with movement. Yet the doctors believe that she is getting well much faster than they expected, and feel that Jeanna will be able to return to her high school studies, needing only physical and occupational therapy.

The novel treatment is hailed by doctors as promising, but needs analysis and verification on another human. Jeanna's is the sixth case of human recovery from a rabies infection, but the other five people were vaccinated against rabies either before infection, or before the symptoms appeared."

"Margaret Pardoel, mother of the first Australian soldier to be killed in Iraq since the commencement of hostilities, has expressed anger over the","death of her son.
Speaking at a press conference in Sydney on Tuesday, Mrs Pardoel said she was angry that her son had been sent to fight in Iraq and that he had died for ""nothing"".
""I'm very angry,"" she said. ""He shouldn't have gone there.""
Mrs Pardoel said she had not been told by Defence officials why her son had been sent to Iraq.
""They didn't tell me anything,"" she said. ""I don't know what they were doing there.""
She said she had no idea whether her son","death of her only son, a father of three, who was about to return home to Australia and had been planning a career change. Mrs Pardoel and husband John were devastated by the loss of their only son.

Mrs Pardoel said she opposes the war. ""I think it's just cold-blooded murder. Look at all those young American boys that have been slaughtered,"" she said. ""I don't think this should have gone on ... He said to me one night he phoned, he said, 'Mum there's nowhere to hide here, it's just so dangerous, there's nowhere to hide'.""

Thirty-five year old Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel had been on his last flight when the C-130 Hercules he was aboard crashed north of Baghdad yesterday, killing ten personnel. He was serving with the British Royal Air Force (RAF), to which he had transferred several years ago from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), as Navigator in 47 Squadron Lyneham RAF.

Mr Pardoel had been expecting to return in July to his wife and three children in Australia, where they had recently bought a new house in Canberra.

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, says he is saddened to hear of the man's death.

""I want his family to know, and his friends to know, that he certainly did not die in vain, that this tragic accident occurred - or this tragedy because it may not have been an accident - but this tragedy occurred on a day when 65 per cent of the people of Iraq went out and voted,"" he said."
"Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found","in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana.
Scientists have discovered soft tissue from a T-Rex fossil that was buried for millions of years. The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.
The researchers examined the fossilized remains of a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex and found evidence of blood vessels, cells, and proteins. This is the first time scientists have been able to identify these types of tissues in a dinosaur.
""This is the first time we've seen this type","in a sandstone formation in Montana.

MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science.

Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. “Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.”, paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Richard A. Hengst of Purdue University said the finding ""opens the door for research into the protein structure of ancient organisms, if nothing else. While we think that nature is conservative in how things are built, this gives scientists an opportunity to observe this at the chemical and cellular level.""

Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said the discovery was ""pretty exciting stuff."" ""You are actually getting into the small-scale biology of the animal, which is something we rarely get the opportunity to look at."""
"Speaking in Texas, President Bush in a Wednesday address to the American Legislative Exchange Council in the city of Grapevine said, ""","I'm confident that we will prevail because we are on the side of freedom and liberty.""
President Bush also said he was confident that Iraq would be able to govern itself.
""We're making progress,"" he said. ""The Iraqi people are beginning to see their government take responsibility for providing basic services like electricity and water.""
He added, ""And as they do, more and more Iraqis are taking responsibility for their own security.""
Bush also said that the U.S. military is working with Iraqi forces to train them to defend their country.
""As our troops","The violence in recent days in Iraq is a grim reminder of the enemies we face.""

""After September the 11th, I made a commitment to the American people that the United States of America will not wait to be attacked again."" Bush said. ""We will take the fight to the enemy, and we will defend our freedom.""

There has been debate within the Administration as to how to refer to the ongoing conflict. In recent appearances, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has avoided using the word ""war"", preferring the phrase ""global struggle against violent extremism."" Bush's speech marks a return to the existing phrase ""war on terror"". In the speech he acknowledged that the struggle is against those who use terror to achieve their goals, implicitly recognising that the term ""war on terror"" may be misleading.

""Make no mistake about it, this is a war against people who profess an ideology, and they use terror as a means to achieve their objectives,"" he said.

Of the military strategy in Iraq, Bush said that coalition forces continue to hunt down terrorists, and the Iraqi security forces are being trained to take on more responsibility. ""As Iraqis stand up, Americans and coalition forces will stand down,"" Bush said. ""And we're making progress. More and more Iraqi units are more and more capable of defending themselves.""

The return of American forces to U.S. soil will be event-driven decision, he said. A timetable for withdrawal is not practical because it would give the enemy a tactical event upon which to plan.

Politically, Iraq's National Assembly is working on a constitution that members pledged to have ready by August 15. The Iraqi people would then vote on the constitution October 15. If passed, the new Iraqi government under a constitution would be elected December 15.

"The White House announced the selection of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World Bank, replacing John Wolfensohn who retires as acting president after 1","0 years.
Paul Wolfowitz is a former U.S. deputy secretary of defense and was an architect of the Iraq war. He has been a strong advocate for free trade and globalization.
The World Bank is a multilateral development institution that provides loans to developing countries for capital projects. It is a member of the World Bank Group which also includes the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA).
Wolfowitz will take over from Acting President John J. Wolfensohn on June 1st.","0 years. The switch is expected to occur sometime in June.

The choice of Wolfowitz is raising controversy in Europe and developing nations. Known as hawkish and outspoken, Wolfowitz was a pro-Iraqi war neo-conservative in his role as deputy Secretary of Defense, and a chief architect in the build up to war with Iraq. Some question whether Wolfowitz, who was criticized for brushing aside European and NATO calls for caution before the Iraq war, would use the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as tool to extend U.S. foreign policy interests.

Historically, it has been the White House’s prerogative to name the candidate because the U.S. holds a majority on the 24 member board, but board members from nations other than the U.S. are seeking their own interviews to qualify the candidate before a change is made. ""The executive directors have agreed to conduct informal meetings over the coming days with the US nominee as part of the consultative process."" the IMF said in a statement. ""Thereafter, the executive directors will meet in a formal session to select the president at which time an official announcement of the outcome will be made,"" it said. The vote is set for March 31, the same day Wolfensohn retires.

Rob Nichols, the US Treasury spokesperson, said Wolfowitz has begun scheduling meetings with board members and that, ""Our nominee… looks forward to meeting with and listening to members of the World Bank board."" Reuters reported. In the meantime, Wolfowitz has worked to assure those with concerns of him, saying he would come with an open mind and no political program."

"United States President George W. Bush's nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security, Bernard Kerik, has declined to continue through Senate confirm","ation hearings after it was revealed that he had not paid taxes on a nanny who worked in his home.
President Bush nominated Mr Kerik to head the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last month.
Mr Kerik said he would withdraw from consideration because he did not want to be a distraction to the president or the DHS.
""I have always prided myself on being a man of integrity and accountability, and I believe that this is the best course of action,"" he said in a statement.
The New York Times reported that Mr Kerik had failed to pay taxes on","ation. In a letter to President Bush, Kerik explained that the immigration status of a housekeeper and nanny, as well as nonpayment of income tax on the housekeeper were his reasons for retracting.

However, Kerik's past dealings may have been the strongest reason for his decision to withdraw from the nomination. Newsweek has uncovered that as recently as 1998, a New Jersey judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kerik following a tangled web of lawsuits relating to unpaid bills on a condominum. Newsday and the Seattle Times have reported that Kerik may have business ties to the Mob and allegations of two extramarital affairs have arisen.

In addition, his windfall profit from stock options in Taser International (i.e. ""Taser guns"") with no apparent investment, has been under heavy investigation. Kerik received a profit of more than USD $6 million after selling his stock in early November, just before an Amnesty International report critical of Taser guns was released. Kerik had joined Taser International's board shortly after resigning as New York City's police commissioner; both the NYPD and Department of Homeland Security have purchased large amounts of Taser's non-lethal electroshock weapons."
Russian researchers warn that Western Siberia has begun to thaw as a result of global warming. The frozen peat bogs in this,"region are now releasing methane, which is 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.
Scientists say the release of methane from these bogs could accelerate climate change and lead to an irreversible rise in temperatures.
The researchers say the permafrost in Western Siberia is melting at a rate of about 15 centimeters (six inches) a year. They say the process will continue for decades.
In addition to the release of methane, the scientists say the melting of the","region may hold billions of tons of methane gas, which may be released into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

Sergei Kirpotin, of Tomsk State University warned New Scientist that the event is an ""ecological landslide that is probably irreversible and is undoubtedly connected to climatic warming"".

David Viner, of the University of East Anglia told The Guardian: ""When you start messing around with these natural systems, you can end up in situations where it's unstoppable"". He also warns that this event was not considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

In May, scientists from the University of Alaska found methane ""hotspots"" in eastern Siberia where the gas bubbles out from thawing permafrost bogs at a rate that prevents the surface from freezing.

The permafrost has been intact for 11,000 years and started melting 3 to 4 years ago, according to Kirpotin.

He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.

Zardad denied all charges throughout the trials, and claimed he had been set up by enemies in Afghanistan.

""I have never killed anybody and if anybody in the whole of Afghanistan can produce that evidence against me then I will accept that crime,"" he said.

The case is considered to be a landmark in international law. British law allows the prosecution of crimes like torture and hostage-taking in the UK even if no British citizen was involved and the incidents occurred overseas. ""There are some crimes which are so heinous, such an affront to justice, that they can be tried in any country"", Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith said.

The BBC reports that at least 20 people have died in clashes between supporters of rival candidates.
The election is being held to replace Africa's first elected female president, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who is stepping down after two terms.
Liberian police say they are investigating claims that some voters were paid to cast their ballots for one","Togo. The election is held to choose a president to replace Togo's recently deceased ruler of 38 years, Gnassingbé Eyadéma.

Last year we were not on this scale. The problem is getting worse,"" Mulangu said.

The UN says that the increase could also be related to the fact that due to poverty, many West Africans move around, sometimes out of the country, in order to receive higher wages for their work, and the region has been hit with heavy rains. This helps spread the disease, according to the UN.

Gmail users will now be able to store 2.8GB of data in their accounts, up from the previous limit of 1GB. The change is effective immediately and applies to all existing Gmail users.
""We're happy to announce that we've increased your free storage space to 2.8 GB,"" wrote Google software engineer Matt Cutts on the official Gmail blog. ""This means you can keep more messages, photos, attachments, and videos, and still have room left over.""
The move comes as a surprise since Google had previously said that it would","based email service from 1 GB to over 2 GB. Additionally, they have added formatting rich-text features to Gmail. According to a page at the Gmail Help Center, while not all accounts currently have the formatting features added, ""over the next several weeks, we are introducing rich formatting to all of our users.""

The increase in storage is announced on the main Gmail page with a JavaScript counter that increases the quoted available storage in relation to the current date. For example, on April 1 at 5 a.m. UTC the site announced 1025 MB available, 30 hours later &amp;mdash; 2050 MB, and a week later it should announce a total of 2075 MB.

Oregon State University (OSU) animal researchers in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Dubois,"Experimental Forest have discovered that a fungus is killing off the whitebark pine trees, which are an important food source for grizzly bears and other wildlife.
Researchers found that the fungus, called blister rust, has been spreading through the forest since 2008, when it was first detected in the area. The disease causes cankers to form on the tree's branches, which eventually kill the tree.
""The whitebark pine is one of the most important food sources for grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone E",", Idaho-based Sheep Experiment Station released a report on an OSU-USDA study which was initiated in 1995 after breeders asked the government to determine why some rams bought as breeding studs showed no interest in females. The researchers are working under a $2.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in hopes of developing a test which can determine the likelihood of a ram being female-oriented before it is sold as a stud.

By studying difference in the animal's brains after slaughter, the study also showed what could be a biological determiner for what makes a ram male-oriented instead of female-oriented sexually. The scientists' results showed that the anterior preoptic area of the rams' hypothalamus was 50 percent smaller in male-oriented rams as opposed to female oriented rams. A 1991 study of human brains of AIDS victims showed a similar hypothalamus size difference between gay and heterosexual men.

The sheep researchers postulate that low levels of aromatase hormones in the brain of a developing male sheep fetus may have kept the brain from fully masculinizing, leading to sexually male-oriented rams.

""This lends further support to the idea that homosexuality has biological underpinnings,"" Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology, said in an interview with the Corvallis Gazette-Times.

Professor Stormshak believes that ""understanding sexual drives and the continuum of sexual behavior could possibly help explain the scientific basis of sexual assault and put an end to assertions that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."""

Six more teenagers, also in a critical state, and twenty others with lesser injuries have been admitted to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, County Louth.

The bus was carrying secondary school students from four schools home when the accident occurred. At present it is unknown what caused the accident - but it is suspected that the two cars collided head on and the bus then attempted to swerve in order to avoid them, causing it to topple over. Several investigations have begun; including one by the Gardaí and one by Bus Eireann.

He posted his concerns to the Apple support forums, but his post was deleted. He created www.nanoscratch.com to allow other users to post comments on the iPod’s “scratchability” and post photos of scratched iPods.

""This is a real but minor issue that involved a vendor quality problem in a small number of units,"" said Apple spokesperson Tom Neumayr. Apple estimates that these issues affected less then 0.01% of the total iPod Nanos shipped.

In most individual cases Apple has been telling customers that the scratches and cracks were covered under warranty.

""That does not mean that they were conscious but that they had breath and circulation. They had circulation and heartbeat so they were alive.""

Initial reports from the Greek Defence Ministry had suggested the bodies were ""frozen solid"" at the moment of impact.

The coroner stressed that as more post mortems were carried out new evidence may come to light.

"The growing power of the Internet is clearly reflected in the decision, announced Tuesday, for the Associated Press to begin charging newspapers and broad","casters a fee for using its stories.
The AP has been giving away its news content for free on the Web since 1995. But now it says that the cost of providing that service is too high, and that it needs to recoup some of those costs.
The move comes as newspapers are struggling with declining circulation and advertising revenue. And it's not just the AP: Other news organizations have also begun charging fees for their online content.
But the AP's announcement is significant because it represents a major shift in the way news is distributed. For dec","casters to post wire stories, photos, and other content on their online editions. The changes go into effect January 1, 2006. An advisory committee meeting will be held in the fall to ease the transition.

As the Internet draws more news consumers from traditional repositories of data, increasing numbers are demanding the stories on the Internet reflect the quick updating and coverage of a large wire network such as the Associated Press.

The rates the AP charges, known within as “assessments”, have risen by about 2.75 percent annually during the 90’s. Since the service is supposed to be not-for-profit and is owned by its customers, price increases are a tough sell.

The formula for the new calculations still has not been set, making it difficult to determine how the changes will affect what the outlets charge for their online news coverage. Currently the AP bases rates on newspaper circulation or broadcast audience with the large ones footing the major part of the bill.

The AP is creating a computer database of news paraphernalia which includes stories, photos, graphics, audio and video. It is all designed to make it easier for news rooms to create usable content."

She was released without charge on May 13 after US authorities said she had no further intelligence value.
Mr Howard said he had asked Attorney-General Philip Ruddock to conduct the inquiry.
The prime minister said: ""I have asked the attorney-general to conduct an inquiry into the very regrettable","months and allegedly maltreated by the country's own Immigration Department.

The woman, Cornelia Rau, still insisted she was German Anna Schmidt, according to her sister Christine yesterday. ""I think it will take a long time for her to stabilise,"" she said. ""At the moment she doesn't accept that she is Cornelia and she doesn't want to see us.""

""She is still insisting her name is Anna Schmidt and that her passport is in Baxter and that she wants to return to Germany.""

Refugee advocate Pamela Curr claims Ms Rau was held in isolation for 18 to 20 hours a day in Baxter's 'Red One' isolation facility, where she was allegedly kept in simulated daylight for 24 hours a day.

Her family had only discovered her whereabouts through a refugee-initiated effort to identify the woman, authorities having failed to connect the unidentified detainee with her missing person file, held by New South Wales Police since August last year.

After her family recognised media reports of her on Thursday, and contacted the police, her photo was emailed to the Baxter compound and her identity confirmed.

Mo was one of the most popular politicians in Britain and her death will be mourned by many people across the country. She was a great friend to the Irish and she will be sorely missed.

Another former cabinet minister, Clare Short, said: ""She was a very beautiful young woman, she survived ill health and helped bring peace to Northern Ireland and now she's gone far too young.""

Mo Mowlam was central to the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and was popular in Britain for her straightforward approach, informality and honesty.

Ms Mowlam even received a standing ovation during prime minister Blair's speech during the 1998 Labour Party Conference.

Mo Mowlam retired from political life in 2001, but continued to make the headlines by realising her autobiography which was critical of Blair's presidential style of government.

It is thought that the fall that made her go to hospital, and then the hospice where she died, was due to a lack of balance caused by a brain tumour."

With a reputation for preventing any rivals from challenging its monopoly, but also for providing an efficient service, ICE has recently seen its monopoly dented with as many as 20% of calls being routed through Skype and other VoIP service providers.

On the other hand those who seek to promote the software industry in Costa Rica, which already has a dominant 78% share of the market in Central America and the Caribbean, have reacted by saying the proposal would be disastrous both to software development and the country's ability to outsource work. The ICE claims that its telephone structure is being used by VoIP service providers, which is almost certainly true given that Skype offers calls from the Internet to phones in Costa Rica for 8 US$ cents per minute."
"Irish low fares airline Ryanair has announced it is to commence service of two new routes from Shannon Airport in County Clare, Ireland. It","will operate a twice weekly service to London Stansted and a three times weekly service to Liverpool.
Ryanair’s Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said: “We are pleased to announce our first ever services to London Stansted and Liverpool from Shannon Airport, which will deliver 100,000 customers per annum and support 500 jobs at the airport and in the local tourism industry.”
The new routes will be operated by Ryanair’s Boeing 737-800 aircraft with 189 seats. The flights will go","will now fly to Bristol, England daily and to Nantes, France three times a week. The airline will also increase the frequency of its Shannon-Frankfurt route.

Shannon airport has seen its traffic figures soar in the past year since Ryanair established a new base there. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has said he expects the new routes to bring an additional 200,000 passengers to the airport.

Despite the positive announcement of the new routes on Thursday, Ryanair's share price plunged by 10% on the same day due to the London bombings that morning. However the share price recovered substantially on Friday.

Ryanair is the world's most profitable airline, having reported record profits of €269m earlier this year, and is pursuing an aggressive expansion plan which will see it's total number of passengers jump to 70m over the next few years. At present Ryanair has 91 aircraft and 230 Boeing 737's on order."
The BBC reported on January 27 that statistics released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health showed that Coalition forces killed 60% of the,"civilians who died in Iraq during the first three months of 2005.
According to the report, the figures show that 1,340 civilians were killed between January and March 2005, with 809 of them dying as a result of coalition military action.
The report also said that the number of civilian deaths caused by insurgents fell from 280 in the last quarter of 2004 to 140 in the first quarter of 2005.
The report quoted Dr Ali al-Sh","civilians that died in the period July 2004 to January 2005.

The figures, normally available only to the Iraqi cabinet, show a total of 3,274 Iraqi civilians were killed and 12,657 wounded during the continuing conflict. These figures exclude the deaths of known insurgents.

However according to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, the BBC misunderstood the matter. According to the previous story from BBC these figures were a result of Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces military operations.

However, the Iraqi Ministry of Health explained that the published figures also include Iraqis killed by terrorists, not only those killed by Coalition forces or Iraqi security forces; and that those recorded as killed in military action included terrorists themselves, and Iraqi security forces.

The BBC recognized their error and apologized in a recent news item, and retracted the conclusions drawn by their original report:

""The BBC regrets mistakes in its published and broadcast reports yesterday,"" reported the BBC.""

The figures, based on records from Iraqi public hospitals released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health, are shown in the following table:

Shortly before the release of the figures by the BBC, US Ambassador John Negroponte had told BBC reporter John Simpson:

""My impression is that the largest amount of civilian casualties definitely is a result of these indiscriminate car bombings."""

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has apologized for Japan's wartime aggression, saying he was ""deeply pained"" by the suffering it had caused.
In a speech at the opening of a summit of Asian and African leaders, Mr. Koizumi said he wanted to express his feelings about the past.
He said he was deeply pained to think of the hardships endured by the people of Asian countries during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule, and that he felt a deep sense of responsibility as the leader","aggression in the 1930s and 40s.

""In the past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility,"" after this Koizumi added that the Japanese people have ""feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology.""

Koizumi's apology was the first apology offered by a Japanese leader for its country's past in the presence of such a large number of government leaders from different countries."

This is the last scheduled walk for the Expedition 10 crew.

At 06:25 UTC, the two astronauts left the station from the Pirs DC1 docking compartment/airlock and proceeded to install the last three of six space-to-space communication antennas for the ATV's rendezvous and docking with the ISS next year.

Sharipov next deployed the foot long, 11 pound Russian Nanosatellite, tossing it into space by hand. The object of the experiment is to develop small satellite control techniques, monitor satellite
operations and develop new attitude system sensors. Russian ground crews reported good signal reception from the satellite two hours after its release.

The two astronauts next proceeded to the aft end of the Zvezda service module. A Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna and necessary cabling for the ATV was installed and the men worked their way back to the airlock.

The station maintained its attitude, despite the loss of a gyroscope earlier in the space station mission, until the end of the spacewalk. Chiao and Sharipov reported being a safe distance from the attitude adjustment thrusters. Russian ground control activated the jets and normal attitude of
the station was regained.

They returned to the airlock at 1055 UTC, completing the mission an hour earlier than scheduled.

Chiao and Sharipov arrived on the station October 16, 2004. They are scheduled to return to Earth on April 25, 2005. This marks Sharipov's second walk in space and Chiao's sixth."

He was being treated for acute respiratory failure, it added.

Pope John Paul's condition was described as ""serious but stable"" by his personal physician, Dr Renato Buzzonetti.

The pope was last seen in public on Wednesday when he appeared at his window overlooking St Peter's Square to","atican said in a statement that the Pope, 84, is suffering from an acute respiratory infection. He was admitted to the Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital at 2300 local time (2200 UTC).

According to the Vatican the Pontiff is suffering from an acute inflammation of the larynx as well as laryngo-spasms that constrict the lung's intake of air. He was diagnosed with a severe flu three days ago and taken to Gamelli as a precaution.

The Pope is no stranger to Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital. In 1981 he was taken there after being shot in the abdomen by Mehmet Ali Agca and he has been re-admitted at least three times since.

Although the Vatican usually does not comment on the pontiff's state of health, it is widely known that the Pope suffers from Parkinson's disease, and chronic joint problems."

Labour leader Andrew Little said the party would not make any changes to the list and that he was confident of winning the next election.
The party has been in opposition since 2008.","2005. The list ranking is often seen as a ranking of the importance for each politician to the party.

Hon. Parekura Horomia was ranked at number five, the highest ranking of any Maori MP. The Maori MPs face a strong challenge from the newly formed Maori Party. Shane Jones, the highest placed non-MP, is all but assured of a seat in the next Parliament. Steven Ching is placed at 42, and represents Labour's interest in courting the Asian vote. The Asian population has grown significantly over the past ten years within New Zealand.

The surprising absentee is Hon. George Hawkins, the Minister of Police. He has been criticised for performing poorly in the House, and it is speculated he was offered a low ranking and refused. He is likely to return to Parliament on the basis of his strong hold on the Manurewa electorate seat.

At the time, no other major political party has released its list.

New Zealand changed its electoral system to MMP in 1996, before then it used FPP. In the 2002 election, Labour won 52 seats. Labour then became government in a minority coalition. Elections are held every three years in New Zealand."
Volunteers began a 60 day bed-rest marathon on March 19 to study simulated weightlessness effects on women astronaut,"s.
Bed rest is the most effective way of simulating microgravity, and has been used for decades by NASA and other space agencies to prepare astronauts for long duration missions in space.
The experiment will be conducted at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) in Moscow, Russia. The IBMP is one of the world’s leading centres for research into human adaptation to extreme environments.
The volunteers are part of an international team of scientists from the UK, USA, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and Ukraine. They will spend two months","s. The study, Women International Space Simulation for Exploration(WISE), is conducted at the MEDES Space Clinic in Toulouse, France.

The 12 women, selected from 1600 applicants hailing from France,Great Britain, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic began the study after a 20 day screening for baseline comparison data as the study progressed.

The women will conduct all activities from eating, bathing, and reading while lying in hospital beds tilted headfirst at a six degree angle. This particular position, called head-down tilt bed rest was determined from previous studies to remove the vertical load of gravity on the body, inducing changes similar to what astronauts in a genuine weightless environment experience .

Long term exposure to weightlessness creates a number of physiological and psychological problems in astronauts such as:
*Reduced capacity for physical exertion
*Muscle atrophy
*Affects of confinement and isolation
*Impaired circulatory function

A total of 24 women will participate in the study. A second group of 12 will join in September.

Three groups of eight women each will be studied over the course of the two campaigns of bed rest. One group will serve as a control, receiving no specific treatments, the second will exercise, while the third will receive nutritional supplements.

The study is designed to fill in gaps of knowledge on the differences between men and women during extended weightlessness. It also aims to develop countermeasures for reducing the debilitating effects of long spaceflights.

Participating agencies in the study include the European Space Agency, NASA, the French Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency."
"The top money grossing entertainers in Australia in 2005 were not Kylie Minogue, Nicole Kidman, or Russell","Crowe. They were the members of the Australian cricket team who played against England in the Ashes series.

"Vladimir Putin has relieved from power Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the head of the Russian navy. This comes a month after an incident","in which a nuclear-powered submarine ran aground on the Pacific coast.
Putin also dismissed the commander of Russia's Northern Fleet, Vice-Admiral Oleg Burtsev, and the commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Rear Admiral Valery Kasatanov.
The three men were replaced by Vice-Admiral Viktor Chirkov, who was previously deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet.
Kasatanov will be replaced by Rear Admiral Alexander Vitko, while Burtsev will be replaced by Rear Admiral Nikolai","where 7 Russian sailors became trapped in a submarine, and had to be rescued with help from abroad.

No reason was given for Kuroyedov's dismissal, although Admiral Eduard Baltin speculated on Moscow Radio that it may be because of the navy chief's poor health. According to Reuters, he told Ekho Moskvy: ""He has been lying in hospital for two months, he had a complicated operation.""

Admiral Kuroyedov was in charge of the navy during the Kursk disaster of 2000, in which 118 sailors died when their submarine sank. Kuroyedov is being replaced by Vladimir Masorin, who was previously serving as the Chief of staff for the Russian Navy.

In remarks Putin made about this leadership change and referring to Masorin, he said ""The recent exercises, including those I have attended, show that the navy is developing and that is certainly your merit to a large extent."" Putin also added ""at the same time, there were difficult events, tragedies, but I would like to underline once again that with all these problems, all these tragedies, the main thing is that the Navy is undergoing a revival.""

Masorin added while in a hall at the Admiralty, ""One thing is clear — to continue in the condition which we are in and do nothing is simply not possible.

"The European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty on April 13
The President of Romania, Traian Băs","escu, has announced that the European Parliament will vote on Romania's accession treaty on April 13.
""I have been informed by the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, that the European Parliament will vote on Romania's accession treaty on April 13,"" said Basescu in a press release.
He added that he had also discussed with the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, about the possibility to sign the treaty on March 25.","escu, met yesterday with Jonathan Scheele, the head of the European Commission's Delegation to Bucharest, as well as with several European parliamentarians (MEPs). The parties discussed Romania's accession to the EU, which is particularly important as the Accession Treaty is scheduled to be signed late this month, after being voted on by the European Parliament on April 13.

Băsescu told the delegation that European integration remains Romania's first priority at the moment, and that after negotiations were closed with the EU in December 2004, accession became a matter of internal politics rather than foreign affairs.

The MEPs talked to Băsescu about public opinion regarding EU accession in Romania, as well as the impact of accession on the rural population. Judging from recent polls, the overwhelming majority of Romania's population approve EU accession, even though this may be partly due to the fact that many of them have not been adequately informed of the costs of accession. The parliamentarians also discussed the environment and the situation in neighbouring countries, especially Moldova. Tourism was also discussed in the context of promoting Romania's image to European Union citizens.

The delegation also discussed with Băsescu a key issue in Romania's accession process: judicial reform. The Romanian President told the MEPs that Romania has taken bold steps to reform its judiciary and fight corruption. There is also progress towards forming an anti-corruption department within the Internal Ministry of Romania.

As part of Romania's foreign policy, Băsescu also said that, once a member of the European Union, Romania would act as an advocate for other Southeastern European states wishing to join the organisation, as well as seeking to attract public attention to the broader Black Sea region. Romania and Bulgariaare the most advanced countries in Southeastern Europe in terms of EU integration, and will therefore be the first countries in this region to join the 25-nation bloc."
The Romanian Government has made plans and identified its aims for the next privatisation program which will end in 2006. By the,"end of this year, the government is expected to sell off 15 companies, including the state-owned oil company Petrom, the largest bank BCR, the national airline Tarom and the telecoms operator Romtelecom.
According to the Finance Ministry, the privatisation program will be completed by 2006 with the sale of 34 companies. The government expects to raise EUR 1.7 billion from the sales.","end of next year, the government hopes to sell all of its shares in Romtelecom, Romania's largest telecommunications company, which is currently owned by Greece's OTE but which the government maintains a 47% share in. The full privatisation will occur in two phases, with some of the government's existing shares being sold on the Bucharest Stock Exchange this year, and the remainder being sold in 2006.

By 2006, the government also wants to sell its share in Postelecom, another telecommunications operator, and complete the privatisation of the Radiocomunicaţii, the national radio communications company.

The Government also wantes to begin analysis and consulting into the privatisation of Poşta Română, or Romanian Post, the full privatisation of which is set to be completed by 2009 at the latest.

Romania has embarked on a quite comprehensive program of privatisation since 2000, having privatised a part of Romtelecom, as well as full privatisations of several energy distributors and the nation's largest banks, in addition to other smaller companies. However, these privatisations are dwarfed by that of Petrom, Romania's national oil company, which was bought by Austria's OMV in 2004 and is the largest Romanian privatisation ever.

The current Liberal-Democrat governing coalition in Romania has privatisation and economic liberalism as one of its main policies, having also introduced a 16% flat tax rate for personal income and corporate profits at the start of 2005."

The union also says the university has not addressed issues related to sexual harassment and discrimination.
The university said in a statement that it was disappointed the union chose to strike and that it would continue to work toward a fair contract.","within the UC system. The Coalition of University Employees (CUE) labor union estimates that around 10,000 university workers are on strike. Other strikes related to this are occurring at UCSF Medical Center, UC Santa Cruz, and four other UC campuses around the state.

The Coalition of University Employees accuses top UC officials of ignoring the union's requests regarding the high turnover rate of researchers. CUE organizers say the university is misleading the union about the quantity of money readily available for employee salary increases.

The UC officials deny accusations that they have bargained in bad faith, saying they have offered a contract to the researchers that's similar to an approved deal.

The terrorists which kidnapped them aired a tape on Al-Jazeera, on April 23, that they would kill the journalists by April 27 if Romania does not withdraw its 860 troops from Iraq. Romania declined to withdraw the troops, and it seems the terrorists did not enforce their deadline.

Samsung announced it will market DVD players capable of playing back both Sony's Blu-Ray and Toshiba's HD DVD next,"year.
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a world leader in advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced that it has developed the industry’s first dual format high definition (HD) optical disc player. The new product is capable of playing back both HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats, which are currently competing as the next generation of optical disc technology for high definition video content.
The company plans to begin mass production of the dual format HD optical disc player in the second half of 2006.
“We believe that consumers should have the freedom to choose from among various technologies,”","-generation optical storage formats, if the two camps refuse to compromise on a single format. Assuming development is successful, consumers could expect to see such a device on store shelves next year.

Blu-Ray and HD DVD are projected to be the successor formats for current DVDs. Samsung, while leaning towards the Blu-Ray camp, hopes it can cover both bases by distributing a player with dual-compatibility. While this means spending more in development to unify the two technologies and develop a cost-effective production method, dual compatibility may pay off for the company if the formats challenge each other as VHS and Betamax did twenty-five years ago. Despite the support for Blu-Ray, Samsung has also been supportive of a unified standard to avoid such costly competition.

HD DVD offers single layer capacity of 15GB, more than triple the size of standard single layer DVDs, and benefits from similarities with current DVDs, such as cheap production and compatibility with current DVD players. Blu-Ray can hold 23GB on its smallest single layer version, and is reported to have superior durability and interactivity over current DVD-based technology and HD-DVD. HD-DVD is currently promoted by Toshiba, NEC, Sanyo and Microsoft; while Blu-Ray's base of support is the Blu-Ray Disc Association, which is led by Blu-Ray developers Sony and Philips. It is notable that Sony and Philips, who developed the Blu-Ray format, also competed against the Toshiba-designed SuperDisc DVD standard, which is the standard that is followed today.

The first Blu-Ray and HD DVD products are expected to start appearing in mainstream markets within the next year."

Maniche is one of the most talented players in Europe. He has been playing for Porto since 1998 and was part of the Portuguese squad that won Euro 2004. The midfielder has played 35 matches for his country and scored 7 goals.
Costinha is also a member of the Portuguese national team. He has been playing for Porto since 1996 and has made 15 appearances for his country.",". Their transfer cost was 16 and 4 million euros respectively, making this the most expensive transfer deal in Russian football. The head of Dinamo's board of directors, Alexey Fedorychev, is among the wealthiest Russian businessmen and he is responsible for making the money available to the club. Another Dinamo transfer target is the Greek footballer Seitaridis, also playing for Porto, but this deal has not yet been confirmed.

Despite conceding an early goal, Amkar was able to fight back, score from a penalty and secure a slender lead to win the away game.

Despite numerous signings between seasons and hiring a new coach, Oleg Romantsev, Dinamo's performance is far from the best. Last season saw them at 14th place (out of 16), barely avoiding relegation, and the start of a new season isn't promising either.

It began its existence flying a small 15 seat aircraft between Waterford and London Gatwick with the small aim of breaking the duopoly on London-Ireland flights, held at that time by British Airways and Aer Lingus. Today however, the airline now flies to over 200 European destinations with its fleet of 84 Boeing 737's and is awaiting the arrival of a future 225 aircraft from Boeing.

The company today carries as much as 3m passengers a month (depending on the season) and has revealed it made a profit of €245m (USD$307,916,000) in the past year. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated that the airline will carry over 70m passengers annually within five years. The notoriously eccentric Mullingar man went on to tell the press ""The very fact that a Mickey Mouse Irish airline can start in a field in Waterford 20 years ago and in 20 years overtake the world's self-styled, self proclaimed favourite airline is testament to the almost unstoppable demand for low airfare travel around Europe.""

To demonstrate the huge drop in airfares over the last year, the company claimed while the price of a Ryanair seat had dropped from £99.99 in 1985 to 99p today, the price of a pint of beer had trebled and the average house price in England had increased by 500%."
"Venezuela recognized that the mother of Ugueth Urbina, Maura Josefina Villareal, was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces","of Colombia (FARC) in 2006.
Venezuela also expressed its concern over the situation of other hostages held by the FARC and called on the Colombian government to do everything possible to secure their release.
The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said it is following with great interest the case of the kidnapping of the mother of former Major League Baseball pitcher Ugueth Urbina, who was abducted by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2006.
“We are concerned about the situation of this woman and we","of Colombia (FARC-EP) commander Alvis Patiño, known as El Chiguiro. Urbina is a Venezuelan and a Major League Baseball right-handed closer who plays for the Detroit Tigers.

Chiguiro has been captured on February 2005. A delegation of authorities from Colombia was sent to Venezuela, so he could be identified. Now, after his identification, Colombian officers expects he can be extradicted to Colombia. In Colombia, Chiguiro is expected to be judged for the alleged crimes of kidnapping and murderer of the American missionaries Sthephen Everet and Thimoty Dike in 1995.

Some Venezuelan baseball players from the Major Leagues said that kidnapping is a new situation they must learn to live with. None of them said that the risk of kidnappings would prevent their return to Venezuela.

For years, Venezuelan cattlemen near Colombian borders say that they are victims of extorsion by FARC forces. This is the first time that the Venezuelan government recognizes that the FARC is responsible by this kind of crime in Venezuela.

According to the Colombian authorities, Chiguiro is envolved with the exchange of drugs by weapons with Brazilian traffic drug dealers."
Pope John Paul II has been re-admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital with a relapse of influenza which saw him hospitalised earlier,"this month.
A Vatican spokesman said the 84-year-old pontiff was admitted on Sunday night and was in stable condition.
The pope had been discharged from the hospital on 10 January after being treated for flu, but he returned to the hospital on Saturday suffering from fever and breathing difficulties.
He is expected to remain in hospital for at least two days, according to Italian media reports.
Pope John Paul has suffered from Parkinson's disease since 1996 and has undergone several operations.","this month.

He was wheeled into Gemelli Hospital on a partially elevated stretcher, and was waving to people as he entered the clinic.

Later, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls announced that the pope had undergone a tracheotomy to assist his breathing.

The Pope's re-admittance again raises questions about how long his papacy will last. One of his close aides refused to rule out the possibility of the Pope retiring saying it was up to his ""conscience"". The Pope has recently indicated that he has no intention of retiring by saying that the call ""to guard his flock"" was ""particularly alive in him"".

In a scene repeated across much of America, each morning a group of day laborers, mostly immigrants, assemble by a 7-Eleven convenience store in the hopes of getting work.

Each day, nearly 200 people gather near the nation's capital in Herndon, Virginia; these laborers do much of the hard and dangerous work not wanted by most U.S. citizens. This daily gathering has drawn both the ire and compassion of the Herndon community. A public hearing Monday night to discuss a new plan drew an overflowing crowd to the Town Council chambers. The Commission said so many people signed up to speak at the hearing that the panel will need to convene again Tuesday night.

For years groups and businesses among the community who want to help the day laborers have been working on the issue. In a plan spearheaded by Bill Threlkeld, of the group Project Hope and Harmony, they lobbied Herndon officials to use taxpayer money to build a regulated day laborer center in an old police station at the edge of town. This they say would get the day-laborer group(s) off the street. The plan has the backing of Herndon mayor, Michael L. O'Reilly.

The plan would also combine the opening of the center with a new local ordinance that would make it a misdemeanor crime for a laborer to seek work at any location other than the official one. Opponents of the plan say the town would be aiding illegal immigrants if it established the center.

A Pew Hispanic Center survey found a 25% increase over four years in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The number now is estimated to have reached about 10.3 million. Local governments do not have the authority to enforce national immigration laws, so the town of Herndon must rely on federal officials, who show little interest in getting involved."

Helsingin Sanomat reports that a Finnish soldier has been convicted of sexual assault on another conscript, but that the case is not related to the allegations of widespread abuse in the army.
The newspaper says it has seen photographs showing male conscripts being sexually abused and humiliated by their superiors. The photos are said to have been taken at a military base in Lapland.
The paper says the pictures were sent to its reporter by an anonymous source who claims to be a former member of the armed forces.
The source",", which turned out to be a prank. They allegedly show conscripts masked and with gas masks over genitals.

In the images, released through Internet forums, soldiers are humiliated by their officers, being forced to act like dogs with other soliders holding their leashes. The Defence Forces communications director Ossi Kervinen considers the matter unfortunate.

The images are strikingly similar to those that came out of the Abu Ghraib prison last year.

Finland has a policy of neutrality, with a requirement of conscription for all men between the ages of 18-30 for 180 to 362 days. However, they can opt to do civil service work instead, which lasts 13 months."
U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema accepted would-be hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui's guilty pleas on,"all six terrorism conspiracy charges against him, but said she will not sentence him until after the trial of his alleged coconspirators in the Sept. 11 attacks.
Moussaoui, who was arrested in August 2001 and has been held without bail since then, had previously pleaded innocent to the charges. He changed his plea last week.
Brinkema set a sentencing date for April 11, 2006. She also ordered that Moussaoui be transferred from the Alexandria Detention Center to the federal prison","six charges of conspiracy laid against him for his plotting to participate in the Sept. 11 attacks.

36-year-old Moussaoui, a French citizen, faces the death penalty or life in prison in the sentencing phase of his trial. The prosecution has also asked that Moussaoui be forced to pay restitution to the victims of the attack.

19 hijackers took control of four planes on September 11, 2001. Nearly four weeks before the attack, Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota on immigrations charges having raised the suspicions of instructors at a flight school.

"European aircraft manufacturer, Airbus, has won an order from Qatar Airways for up to 60 of its new mid-sized A","321XLR aircraft.
Airbus said the deal was worth $6 billion at list prices and would be finalised in July.
The A321XLR is a long-range version of the A321neo that can fly routes of up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 km).
Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar al-Baker said the airline had been impressed by the performance of the A321LR, which he described as “a game changer”.
“This is why we are excited about the","350 jets. The order, which is believed to be worth $15 billion, has given a boost to an otherwise disappointing Paris Air Show, which had been dominated by a state aid dispute between Airbus and Boeing.

Qatar Airways, which choose the Airbus A350 over Boeing's 787, will also purchase 20 of Boeing's larger 777 planes for $4.6 billion. Qatar has a previous order for 2 of Airbus' massive new A380's which it will begin to fly in 2009 out of London Heathrow.

"As they have done for the last four years, United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientists were measuring an approximate 100 square","mile area of the Gulf of Mexico in a project called the “Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Natural Resource Damage Assessment.” The purpose of this study is to determine how much oil was spilled into the Gulf and what impact it had on the environment.
According to the USGS, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was the largest accidental marine oil spill in history, releasing approximately 4.9 million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of 87 days.
The USGS has been conducting studies since the","mile bulge in central Oregon near the South Sister this past August. The bulge is located 25 miles outside of the city of Bend, Ore. and three miles from the South Sister.

The results of this years survey won't be available for some weeks, but geologists have come to some conclusions based on the past four years of monitoring. The intial discovery was made by using information from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Interferometric Satellite Aperture Radar satellite. Scientists believe the bulge is rising at a rate of 1.4 inches per year and is due to a large lake of fluid (likely magma) that is 4.5 miles below the surface. They also think the fluid covers an area about one mile across and extends to a depth of 65 feet. The pooling fluid could be shifting magma or the creation of a new volcano.

Ground swells aren't an extraodinary occurrence in geology. Geologists suspect that these ground swellings occur in the Cascade Range and at other volcanoes, and the majority of them do not lead to eruptions. Using the same ESA satellite technology, geologists have seen lots of bulges in the Aleutian Islands that have not lead to eruptions."

"Romania's national airline, TAROM, has announced that, from May 15 this year, all of its flights from Buch","arest to London will be operated by the new Airbus A318 aircraft.
TAROM is the first European carrier to operate the A318 in scheduled passenger service and the only one to fly it on routes between Europe and North America. The aircraft is configured with 12 business class seats and 96 economy class seats.
The A318 is a member of the Airbus A320 family of short-to medium range, single-aisle, twin-engine jet airliners. It was developed at the request of customers for greater operating flexibility.
The A","arest, the Romanian capital, to Arad, a city in the country's west, will be cancelled, due to lack of financial viability and an increase in competition. The reason for the cancellation is mainly due to the planned inauguration on May 16 of a Bucharest-Arad flight operated by the private airline Carpatair, Romania's second-largest airline.

Carpatair has grown very quicly in the past two years, adding several new destinations, both in Romania and abroad. Also, it has taken away many of TAROM's customers on international routes because it provides direct connections from Transylvanian cities such as Arad and Timişoara to German and Italian cities, saving customers the task of changing flights at Bucharest. Also, although Carpatair started out as a Transylvanian airline, it now also flies to destinations in Romania's east, and is expected to open up new routes via Bucharest, in a further attempt to compete with TAROM and win more market share.

In 2004, TAROM was Romania's largest airline, carrying approximately 940,000 passengers. Carpatair came in at second, carrying approximately 271,000 passengers."

Tyco International Ltd., a maker of medical devices and electronic equipment, said it will restate its financial results for 2003 through the first quarter of 2005 to reflect an accounting error that overstated earnings by about $2 billion.
The company also said it would delay filing its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission until March 14.
Tyco said it discovered the error in December after reviewing its accounting practices. It said the error was caused by improperly recording revenue from sales of","$600 million from the company. Charges include grand larceny, securities fraud, conspiracy, and falsifying business records.

The first trial ended in a mistrial after one juror received a threatening letter. Nancy Salomon says of the second trial that the ""Defense was counting on the jury not reaching a verdict; they had used their challenges during the jury selection process to kick almost every potential juror who had a college degree, or had any business experience or Wall Street experience off the jury ... they were hoping that this case was just going to be too confusing for the jury."" While the jury did take 11 days to arrive at their decision, they found Kozlowski and Swartz guilty on 22 of the 23 counts. To combat the aggressive jury selection strategy undertaken by the defense, the prosecution ""basically gave the jury several credit hours worth of an MBA"", teaching them about following paper trails and detecting falsification of business records. It paid off during deliberation as the jury requested over 100 documents to review.

Kozlowski and Swartz directly stole approximately $150 million USD from Tyco and acquired $430 million more by inflating the company's stock value and then secretly selling company shares. Bail was set at $10 million each. The two former executives face a minimum of eight years in prison, up to a maximum of 25 years. In addition, Kozlowski is accused of evading $1 million in sales taxes on six paintings that he bought in 2001 in a separate New York State case, and Swartz faces tax evasion charges in New Hampshire. If convicted in these cases as well, they would face up to 30 years in prison."

Fuel subsidies have been a major drain on the government budget, but the government is reluctant to cut them because of their political popularity. The government has tried to reduce the impact by increasing the number of people eligible for subsidized fuel. However, this has only increased the cost of the program.

"At Thursday's keynote presentation of the Tokyo Game Show, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata unveiled the controller design","for the Wii U.
Nintendo has been working on a new controller for its next-generation console, and it looks like this is what they came up with. The controller features a touchscreen in the middle, as well as two analog sticks, four face buttons, and shoulder buttons. It also appears to have a camera built into the top of it.
The controller will be able to communicate wirelessly with the Wii U console, which will allow players to use the controller from anywhere in the room.
Iwata said that the controller was designed to make it easier for developers to create games for the","for the company's new Nintendo Revolution console. Resembling a television remote, the controller uses two sensors placed near the user's television to triangulate its position in three-dimensional space. This will allow players to control actions and movements in video games by moving the device through the air.

The remote control design is said to target new players who are unfamiliar with traditional video game controllers.

A supplementary peripheral has also been shown, consisting of a separate plastic grip that is designed to be held in the player's second hand. It provides an analog stick and two trigger buttons, and connects to the bottom of the main controller with a simple cord. Additionally, Nintendo has suggested that the main controller will be able to slide inside a ""shell"" that will allow it to function like a conventional video game controller.

The Revolution is expected to be released next year.

A World Health Organization (WHO) committee comprising of 43 African health ministers has declared a tuberculosis emergency on the,"continent.
Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that usually affects the lungs, but can also spread to other parts of the body. It is transmitted through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, sneeze or spit.
The WHO said the declaration was made after it reviewed the latest data on the disease and found that Africa had the highest burden of TB globally.
“Africa bears more than two-thirds of the global incidence of multidrug-resistant TB (MD","continent.

The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in African countries per year has quadrupled since 1990, and continues to rise. Now 540,000 people die of the disease in Africa every year.

Worldwide, TB kills two million people a year; the only deadlier disease in the world is HIV/AIDS.

Some African countries such as Tanzania and Malawi pioneered TB control strategies that were later adopted around the globe. But they were not successful - Malawi saw the number of TB cases a year rise by four times over the past 15 years. Poverty, poor health systems and HIV have been blamed by the WHO for this.

Funding is a particularly critical issue. Eight of the nine worst affected African countries reported that, for 2003, they had short-falls in the funding their TB control programmes needed. However the WHO stresses that money alone will not end the crisis - health systems must be improved, and the rate at which health professionals are lost in the region must be reduced.

Africa is the only region in the world to be experiencing an increase in TB cases - in the rest of the world, infection rates are either stable or falling."

The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than two million others, many of whom have fled to neighbouring countries.

""Overall, the extended effects of four years of drought, which adversely impacted livelihoods and coping mechanisms, combined with chronic food insecurity, and more recently flooding has exacerbated the suffering of Somalis,"" said the report.

OCHA estimates that around 44,000 people were directly affected by the tsunami, and many still need urgent humanitarian assistance, the agency said.

As of June 10, donors had funded approximately 39 percent of this appeal.

Minor violent incidents and claims of Lebanese sabotage marked an unsteady start today for the Israeli-Palestinian tr,"uce that took effect at midnight.
A Palestinian man was shot dead by Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Jenin, while a 16-year-old boy was wounded when he tried to throw a grenade at soldiers in the Gaza Strip.
The army said it had arrested two men suspected of trying to plant explosives near a Jewish settlement in the northern West Bank.
In the first sign of trouble since the ceasefire began, Israeli forces fired warning shots into the air after being pelted with stones by Palestinians in the southern Gaza St","uce, already threatened after militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad announced that they were not bound by the agreement.

Two Israeli motorists escaped uninjured in the West Bank today after coming under fire from Palestinian gunmen.

Elsewhere, Hamas militant Hassan Alami was found dead in the Khan Younis camp of Southern Gaza, killed while carrying out activities for the group. Although Hamas refused to be bound by the agreement signed yesterday in Sharm el-Sheik, it has promised to keep quiet at the request of Mahmoud Abbas.

Another Palestinian man is in a critical condition after being shot in the chest. The man, from the Rafah refugee camp, was shot near the Israeli settlement of Atzmona. The Israeli army, which has a garrison in Atzmona, is looking into the incident.

Meanwhile, Ramallah has accused Lebanese rebel group Hezbollah of attempting to sabotage the fragile peace agreement in the Middle East. The group, backed by Syria and Iran, are attempting to recruit Palestinian militants to engage in attacks of Israeli targets, claim Palestinian spokesmen. The charges mirror those made recently by Israel, which has long accused Hezbollah of bankrolling Palestinian violence in the region.

Hezbollah denies the charges, and claims to be honouring the ceasefire agreed yesterday. However, Palestinian officials claim to have intercepted bank records and email communications that prove that the guerilla group is recruiting militants in the West Bank. Abbas is shying away from any confrontation with the group at the moment, but has sent an envoy to Beirut to persuade Hezbollah to desist from its aggressive activities.

Despite the setbacks, Israel has begun to lift restrictions of travel and issue permits to 1000 Palestinians to work in Israel, as part of Tuesday's deal. Sharon has agreed to travel to Ramallah to continue talks toward peace in the region."

"Guidant Corporation recently announced another safety warning on several models of its implantable defibrillators, cautioning users for the second time in","less than a year that the devices may fail to deliver life-saving shocks.
Guidant said it had received 10 reports of patients who were not successfully shocked by their implanted defibrillators, and that it was issuing an advisory to doctors about the problem. The company also said it would offer free replacement units to any patient who wanted one.
The announcement came just two months after Guidant issued a similar warning about the same models of defibrillators, which are used to treat patients with potentially fatal irregular heartbeats. In that case, Guidant said","a week about the devices. No patients are known to have been injured by the devices at this time.

P&amp;G also announced a stock buyback program in which they would purchase up to US$22 billion of shares over the next 18 months. Including the stock buyback program, the merger is being financed by 60 percent stock and 40 percent cash.

P&amp;G is known for brands such as Ariel and Tide washing powder, Max Factor cosmetics, Pringles potato crisps (chips) and Hugo Boss and Lacoste perfumes.

Gillette, known for brands such as Gillette razors, Oral B dental care, and Duracell batteries, has had growing problems with the growth of private labels and price cuts demanded by large supermarkets.

After the acquisition is completed, Gillette's CEO James Kilts will be P&amp;G's vice-chairman. Kilts said that he expects that this acquisition will cause additional mergers to take place.

""I believe the consumer product industry needs to consolidate,"" said Kilts, ""we believe we can bring these companies together and create a juggernaut.""

P&amp;G and Gillette have a combined market capitalization of about $185 billion US, which will make it the largest in the sector.

The early morning announcement states that 6,000 employees will be eliminated. Most of the layoffs will result from reducing overlapping management positions and other supporting positions within the combined company.

Antitrust regulators in the US and Europe plan to review the acquisition, to determine whether the combined company will have too much power over pricing and shelf space.

P&amp;G plans to provide additional details about the merger Friday morning (East Coast time) in New York."
Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was officially placed under house arrest a day after the country's Supreme Court upheld his,"indictment on charges of human rights violations.
Supreme Court Justice Jorge Zepeda said that Pinochet, 84, would be confined to his Santiago home until he is tried for allegedly ordering the killing of 19 people in 1973.
The court also ordered that Pinochet remain under house arrest during the investigation into the disappearance of 20 other people.
Pinochet has been under house arrest since December 16, when Judge Juan Guzman charged him with the killings and disappearances.
Guzman had previously","indictment of one count of murder and nine counts of kidnapping.

Court officials say the arrest order was delivered to Gen. Pinochet's home near the capital, Santiago, Wednesday. The 89-year-old retired general has been at his home recovering from a stroke he suffered in late December.

A government commission, the Rettig Commission, listed 2,095 deaths and 1,102 disappearances during his 17-year rule. In 2004 the Valech Report that was issued after interviewing an estimated 35,000 people who claimed to have been abused by the regime; 28,000 were regarded legitimate.

The crimes were allegedly committed as part of Operation Condor, a campaign of assassination and terrorization meant to suppress left-wing opposition to Pinochet's regime. The Chilean-led program soon spread to other military regimes throughout Latin America, and may have had at least tacit complicity by then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The Pinochet dictatorship ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990, gaining power after a military coup overthrew the democratically-elected socialist President Salvador Allende."

"The new leader of Togo, the late president Gnassingbé Eyadéma's son, Faure Gnassingb","é, has been sworn in as president.
Faure Gnassingbé was elected by parliament on 4 February to replace his father who died last month after 38 years in power.
The ceremony took place at the national assembly building in Lomé and was attended by several African leaders including Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo.
Mr Gnassingbé said he would work for peace and stability in Togo.
""I will do everything possible to ensure that Togo is a country where there is peace, security and development,"" he told the crowd.","é, pledged to hold ""free and transparent elections which reflect the will of the people"" as soon as possible, though he did not mention a specific timeframe, nor did he address international criticism of his ascession to power.

Togolese politics have become a subject of criticism by the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations after the death of Eyadéma late last week. Eyadéma was Africa's longest-ruling leader whose 38-year rule was marked by government-sponsored violence and the stifling of political expression.

The Constitution of Togo was amended to permit Eyadéma to retain power, to allow more than two five-year terms in office, and to lower the minimum age for a president from 45 to 35. The latter move was seen as a way to allow the succession of the presidency to Eyadéma's son, then only 35 years old.

When Eyadéma died on Saturday of a heart attack, the country's Constitution called for power to be transferred to the head of the national assembly. Instead, Faure Gnassingbé assumed power and the Constitution was amended to allow this, causing criticism from foreign commentators.

Faure Gnassingbé also promised reforms, and an open dialog with the opposition parties. However, with the opposition leader out of the country since an assassination attempt in 1992, and the presidential term not set to expire until 2008, it is not clear how much change these promises will bring in the near future."

Before Menchú was nominated, the Central American states had decided that the candidate should be from Central America. But the Rodriguez scandal has made it difficult for the Central American states to find another candidate they could all endorse.

Chile and Mexico have proposed their own candidate for the job.

President Oscar Berger of Guatemala agrees that Menchú should be the Central American candidate. Menchú has said that if the Central American nations are in agreement, she will happily stand as their candidate.

An indigenous Guatemalan, Menchú won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, and was also prominent in her opposition to the previous FRG government which Berger defeated.

Quigley was the sponsor of the proclamation and plans to play ice hockey in the games.

"Yesterday, the United Nations Security Council said it would take all steps necessary, including the implementation of individual sanctions, in order to ensure that the resolution","s on Iraq are complied with.
In a statement issued yesterday, the 15-member council expressed its concern at reports of continued violations of the embargo and urged member states to implement fully the provisions of the relevant resolutions.
The council also called for full cooperation by all countries with the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The statement was read out by Ambassador Han Seung-soo of South Korea, which holds the rotating presidency of the council this month.
It came after UNSCOM chief Richard Butler","s of the Security Council were adhered to by both sides of the troubled Ivoiran peace process. The remarks followed a briefing to the Security Council by representatives from the UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire and African Union-appointed South African mediators.

""The South African Mediation stated that it will continue its efforts, with the support of the United Nations and the African Union, to ensure the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in Côte d'Ivoire as scheduled, which is the only solution to the crisis,"" the Security Council said in a statement following the meeting.

The next round of elections are scheduled for the end of October although it is widely believed this date is unlikely to be met.

The peace process in Cote d'Ivoire has been on shaky ground following the failure of the rebel forces to begin the disarmament process originally scheduled for 31 July. The rebels, led by the Forces Nouvelles, claimed that Ivorian President Gbagbo had failed to make the necessary legal reforms necessary to begin the disarmament. The international community later ratified the legal changes made by the Ivorian government as being in compliance with the peace deal."
Canadian military officials are being accused of covering up the use of the deadly chemical agent Agent Orange and other defoliants during the 1950,"s and '60s.
Agent Orange was used by U.S. forces in Vietnam to clear jungle for visibility, but it also caused birth defects and cancer among soldiers and civilians.
The allegations were made in a report released this week by the Centre for Research on Globalization, an independent research group based in Montreal.
""It is now well established that the United States sprayed millions of gallons of herbicides over South Vietnam between 1962 and 1971,"" said the report's author, Michel Chossudovsky, a professor at","s and 1960s at a New Brunswick base.

At a public meeting attended by at least 200 people, defence officials said only a small amount of the herbicide was used, over a total of seven days between 1966 and 1967 at the army base to clear foliage to prevent fires during artillery training and to clear the view for soldiers.

The American military was also given permission by the Canadian military to test Agent Orange, Agent Purple, and Agent White during the Vietnam War on less than 500 acres of the Canadian base.

Thursday’s public meeting followed in the aftermath of recent media reports that a U.S. army report indicated the use of Agent Purple, which is considered three-times more toxic than Agent Orange, as part of the spraying program.

When revelations about the use of Agent Purple first surfaced in mid-June, retired sergeant, Earl Graves, said, “They were out in the exercise area and the planes flew over spraying and they were told to just put ponchos over their head, that it wouldn’t hurt them.”

He said 170 soldiers in his regiment died of cancer and many of them died young.

At the public meeting held Thursday afternoon, angry and fearful civilians and veterans voiced fears that the chemicals were responsible for illnesses later developed.

Veteran John Chisholm said soldiers were told the sprays were harmless and to keep their mouths shut. “Now we found out this stuff here is killing us. No wonder all my buddies are dead.”

The Defence Department said Thursday that it was conducting tests to determine the dioxin level in the soil and consulting with the U.S. military to find out the exact carcinogen levels in the sprays used."
"WASHINTON D.C., USA – (Washington Post) A Washington Post report reveals a secret intelligence department created by the Pentagon ""","to track and kill"" terrorists in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
According to the newspaper, the department was established in 2014 under the command of General Stanley McChrystal, former commander of US forces in Afghanistan.
The unit is called Task Force Odyssey Dawn, which has been operating for more than two years without being reported.
The task force is composed of about 300 soldiers from the Army's Special Operations Command, as well as CIA agents and private contractors.
The unit is responsible for tracking and killing terrorist leaders in Iraq","directly responsive to tasking from Secretary of Defense"" Donald Rumsfeld. The report raises questions regarding the legality of the Strategic Support Branch, allegations disputed by Pentagon spokesperson Lawrence T. DiRita:

"To help launch Cape Verde's first public university, the Brazilian government has made the promise to provide organizational advice and to train professors.","Brazil will also donate 10 million reais (US$5.2 million) for the construction of a new campus in Praia, the capital city of Cape Verde.
The announcement was made by Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva during his visit to the archipelago on Wednesday.
""We are going to build a university here,"" said Lula. ""It is not just a matter of building a school, but of building a country.""
Lula added that he would like to see Cape Verde become an example for other African countries.","

According to Fernando Haddad, Brazilian Minister of Education, Brazil will send its professors to the small nation off the African coast to train them in lecturing, marking, and other important skills involved in the profession.

Filomena Martins, Cape Verdean Minister of Education and Human Resource Enhancement, met with Haddad on August 22 to work out the details of the plan, which was first launched by Brazil's President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in July 2004.

Cape Verde also hopes to increase the level of education for the university professors themselves. Of the 300 professors at the planned institution, only 3% have doctorates and only 21% have master's degrees.

Brazil also helps Cape Verde reduce its debt through the Post-Graduate Student Agreement Program. PEC-PG encourages Cape Verdeans to become foreign exchange students in Brazil. In 2005-06, 20 students will participate, with the level increasing to 50 students in the next calendar year."
"In an interview by John D. O'Connor for the American magazine Vanity Fair, it was revealed that W. Mark Felt, a former","associate director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), had been Deep Throat, the anonymous source who provided information to reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein about the Watergate scandal during the early 1970s.
At the time, Felt was the number-two man at the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover. He retired from the bureau in 1973 after 28 years of service, but continued to work as a consultant on security matters until his death in 2008.
The identity of Deep Throat remained","associate director of the FBI during the Nixon Administration, was the anonymous informer called ""Deep Throat"". ""Deep Throat"" helped journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bring down then-president Richard Milhous Nixon through the exposure of the Watergate scandal.

Previously bound by a pledge not to reveal ""Deep Throat's"" identity until after his death, Woodward and Bernstein at first refused to confirm the Vanity Fair report. However, in a story posted late today on the Washington Post website, they verified that Felt was ""Deep Throat.""

However, one of Richard Nixon's biographers, Jonathan Aitken, believes that at least one of ""Deep Throat's"" tips could not have been known by Felt. The Post first reported on the famous 18 1/2 minute gap in a crucial tape at a time when only six people were aware of its existence -- none of them Felt. This raises the possibility that ""Deep Throat,"" though mainly based on Felt, may be a composite character.

Felt has been mentioned as a leading candidate for ""Deep Throat"" by many that have tried to solve the mystery. An article published in the American Journalism Review last fall claimed Carl Bernstein's son once exposed Felt as the mysterious informer. But until now, Felt, Woodward, Bernstein and the Post's former editor Ben Bradlee have all denied it.

Felt, 91, has reportedly been in poor health in recent years. His family says Felt admits to being the source and described him as feeling proud of his role in history and having ""a big grin"" when told of the Vanity Fair article."
An insurgency involving approximately 40 to 60 fighters at Abu Ghraib prison base was repelled by the Iraqi,"Army and Coalition forces.
Abu Ghraib is a large prison complex located on the western outskirts of Baghdad, Iraq. The prison has been used for detention of prisoners since the early 1970s. It was notorious as one of Saddam Hussein's most brutal prisons.
The prison was captured by U.S. forces in April 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom. In June 2004, it was handed over to the Iraqi government.

The conflict, described as intermittent and lasting an hour, involved two car bombs, rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire. Officials in Baghdad reported approximately 20 U.S. service members and 12 prison detainees were wounded. According to the Colonel the attack occurred at 10 a.m. EST.

US forces responded with heavy weapons fire and eventually brought the situation under control. There are no reports how many insurgents were wounded or killed in the battle.

"A search in Wikinews for ""Inquiry"" will return many examples of Public Inquiries conducted by governmental organizations into issues that are often","controversial.
Public Inquiries are a form of investigation, usually conducted by an independent body or person, which is charged with the task of investigating and reporting on a particular issue. The findings of such an inquiry may be used to inform future policy decisions.
Public Inquiries can be either statutory or non-statutory. Statutory inquiries are those that have been established by law, while non-statutory inquiries are those that have not been established by law.
The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was a Canadian federal commission created in 1","deeply controversial.

The processes and terms of reference of such 'Public' Inquiries are normally determined by the commissioning governmental body. However the Internet has now made possible the emergence of a new type of Public Inquiry, called an ""E-Inquiry"" that appears to be not only independent of government but also, like a Wiki, enables anyone who wishes to partake in the Inquiry to do so by contributing evidence and by posing questions that contribute to the process of determining the Terms of reference of the E-Inquiry.

The absence of a US government sponsored independent public inquiry into the Katrina hurricane disaster could well be the spur that led to the development of a new non-profit web site that incorporates a framework for conducting a Public E-Inquiry. That site http://www.ForumKatrina.org carries the banner line ""Katrina Support, Recovery, Planning &amp; E-Inquiry"".

The web site owners have given permission to quote the following extract from its statement on the web site about the objective of its E-Inquiry:

""Everyone who may think of getting involved in the E-Inquiry is asked to remember, at every stage in the process, that the end purpose of the E-Inquiry is to provide recommendations, for the future. The objective of those recommendations is to help everyone to avoid death, disease and destruction in consequence of forthcoming natural and man-made disasters. If those recommendations are to be taken seriously, and this, the first E-Inquiry, is to acquire any public credibility, then the process must be democratic, patently fair and intellectually rigorous.""

It will be interesting to see whether an E-Inquiry is capable of meeting these ideals and whether they become a common feature of internet activity."

A report by the Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) said Mr. Annan had ""failed to take action"" against his son Kojo and other UN officials who were involved in the scandal.
The IIC was set up last year after allegations surfaced that some UN staff members had abused their positions for personal gain.

According to Paul Volcker, head of the Independent Inquiry Committee, ""Our assignment has been to look for mis-or mal-administration in the oil-for-food program and for evidence of corruption within the UN organization and by contractors. Unhappily, we found both.""

The report emphasized that Annan knowingly allowed Saddam Hussein to continue making huge unethical profits off of the program.

While Annan acknowledged that there was blame to pass around, he stated that ""None of us -- member states, Secretariat, agencies, funds and programs -- can be proud of what it has found."" Annan also says that he was at least partly at fault for the corruption; ""The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism.""

On a lighter note, while the report is critical of Annan, it also says that the Oil for Food program did help get food to many Iraqis."

A controversial patent directive has been thrown out in a landslide vote. 648 MEPs out of 680 voted today,"to reject the software patents directive, which would have allowed companies to patent computer programs.
The European Parliament's decision is not binding on member states, but it will be difficult for them to ignore the strength of feeling against the directive. The UK government had supported the directive, and was one of only three countries that did so.
The directive was opposed by many large IT companies, including IBM, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and Oracle. They argued that the directive would stifle innovation and lead to an increase in litigation.
""This is a great day for Europe,"" said Florian Mu","to reject the proposal, aimed at bringing Europe in-line with a similar U.S. bill.

""This is a great victory for those who have campaigned to ensure that European innovation and competitiveness is protected from monopolisation of software functionalities and business methods.

Adversaries to the patent directive claim that a bill covering Intellectual Property (IP) would ""stifle innovation"" in Europe, as it allows the patenting of implementation within software.

The treaty's content has been posted online in order to inform Romanians of the costs, standards and responsibilities of European Union accession. The text was published after the European Commission asked for Romania and Bulgaria to better inform their citizens of what EU accession actually means. Bulgaria similarly made available the content of the treaty, in the Bulgarian language, in early April.

Once the Accession Treaty is signed, Romania and Bulgaria will have to withdraw from the Central European Free Trade Agreement, as they will be integrated into the EU-wide free trade area.

When the two countries join in 2007, the European Union will have 27 members in total and more than 480 million citizens. The timetable for accession, and the implementation of the treaty, however, will be in jeopardy if the European Parliament fails to approve the accession of the two countries on April 13, or if the two countries are deemed unprepared for accession by the European Commission, in which case the so-called safeguard clause will come into effect, postponing accession by one year."

"Dr. Stephen Schoenthaler, a Professor of Criminal Justice at the California State University in Stanislaus, has long argued that there is a","strong correlation between violent video games and aggressive behavior.
Schoenthaler’s research has been cited by numerous media outlets, including CNN, Fox News, and The New York Times. He has also testified before Congress on the subject.
In 2013, Schoenthaler published an article titled “The Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggression: A Meta-Analysis,” which was published in the Journal of Psychology. In it, he analyzed 136 studies on the topic.
“The results of this meta-analysis suggest that expos","link between a healthy diet and decreased aggressive behaviour, as well as with increased IQ and school performance.

Dr. Schoenthaler is well-known for a youth detention center study where violations of house rules fell by 37% when vending machines were removed and the cafeteria replaced canned food by fresh alternatives. He summarizes his findings by saying that “Having a bad diet right now is a better predictor of future violence than past violent behaviour.” In a very large test, Schoenthaler directed a study in meals at 803 New York City schools, in low-income neighbourhoods, finding that the number of students passing final exams increased by 16%.

Critics have questioned some of Dr. Schoenthaler findings, due to the lack of placebo control groups. However, more recent work by Dr. Bernard Gesch, a physiologist at the University of Oxford, has placed some of the work on a more scientific footing. Dr. Gesch found that nutrition supplements produced a 26% drop in violations of prison rules over a placebo, and a 37% decrease in violent offences. The Netherlands has embarked on a wider scale dietary research program in 14 prisons.

The short term behaviour consequences of ingesting sugar are well understood: an initial burst on energy, followed a sugar low in which your body produces adrenalin, which makes you irritable and explosive. However, Schoenthaler and Gesch suggest that there are long term impacts over and above the short term consequences of blood sugar variations."

England won the second test match of the series by an innings and 71 runs, taking a 2–0 lead in the series.

Austral","came close to victory themselves, however Steven Harminson took the wicket of Michael Kasprovic to clinch victory on the fourth day of the game.

The match looked to be in Englands hands following sterling batting from Kevin Pietersen (71, 20) and Andrew Flintoff (68, 73) which left the Australians needing to score 282 to win the match. The tourists were soon in trouble ending the third day at 175-8 with over 100 runs still to score and only 2 wickets in hand.

However on the fourth morning the Australian tailenders scored steadily and despite the loss of Shane Warne for 42 the final wicket pair closed in on the target.

The Edgbaston crowd were reduced to biting their nails as the match came down to the wire; Australia needing just 3 runs to win and England needing just one wicket.

Harmison produced a lifting delivery from just short of a length which Kasprovic could only fend off with a glove through to the England 'keeper Geraint Jones, leaving Australia agonisingly short of a memorable win and the series all square at one match each with three to play.

Scores: England 407 and 182, Australia 308 and 279"
"In Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin adopted the following resolution at their state convention:

:CALLING ON THE UN","ITED STATES CONGRESS TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT BUSH AND VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY FOR LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN JUSTIFYING THE WAR IN IRAQ.

WHEREAS, President Bush and Vice President Cheney have repeatedly lied to the American people in justifying the war in Iraq; and

WHEREAS, the United States Congress has a responsibility to investigate these lies and hold those responsible accountable for their actions; and

WHEREAS, the United States Constitution provides that ""","ITED STATES CONGRESS TO INITIATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST PRESIDENT BUSH, VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY AND DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS

:WHEREAS, the Downing Street Memo shows that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld began planning and executing the war on Iraq before seeking Congressional and UN approval;

:WHEREAS, UN weapons inspectors showed prior to the invasion that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; and

:WHEREAS, there is further mounting evidence that the Administration lied or misled about ""mushroom clouds,"" ""connections to 9/11,"" and ""war as a last resort"" as they sought UN, Congressional, and public approvals;

:THEREFORE, RESOLVED, the DPW asks Congress to immediately begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.

The resolution alleges that the Bush administration ""lied or misled"" Congress and the American people concerning the justification for the war. The ""Downing Street memo"" and reports from U.N. weapons inspectors are mentioned as evidence of deception.

Newly elected state party Chairman Joe Wineke said, ""Democrats, not only in Wisconsin but throughout the U.S., have been outraged by what we believe has been a clear cover-up of why the U.S. went into Iraq,"" and that the resolution expresses ""the sense of frustration that Democrats in Wisconsin have over fighting a war for the wrong reasons.""

Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor, does not think the resolution will be successful and said that even if the House of Representatives began impeachment proceedings against the president and vice president, ""I don't think you can impeach the secretary of defense""."

""The first criminal attack was committed in one church at Muhuta district where a group of FNL fighters fired in the church and killed six people including a pastor. They also injured seven others"", Manirakiza said.

He said the rebels shot dead a local government official and his brother and also kidnapped a policeman in the same district.

""We don't know yet why these people were killed, they may be executed because they refused to adhere to the FNL ideology, as the area where they have been killed is an FNL stronghold.""

Some 300,000 people have been killed since the fighting began in 1993.

Fresh talks between the government and the FNL have raised hopes among diplomats that Burundi can finally lift one of its last big barriers to peace.

Its leader Agathon Rwasa and Burundi President, Domitien Ndayizeye signed on May 15 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a cessation of hostilities deal seen as a significant step toward finally bringing the rebels into the peace process.

The Mozilla Foundation released the second major security update this week for their flagship browser Firefox. The fix patches a serious flaw in the way Firefox,"handles certain types of files, which could allow an attacker to execute malicious code on a victim's computer.
Mozilla has rated the vulnerability as ""critical"" and is urging all users to upgrade immediately.
The bug affects Windows, Mac OS X and Linux versions of Firefox 3.5.2 and earlier. It does not affect Firefox 3.6 or Firefox 4 beta.
According to Mozilla, the vulnerability stems from the way Firefox handles files that are downloaded with the application/x-shockwave-flash MIME type. If a user vis","handles animated GIF image files. Firefox browsers infected by malicious code could experience a buffer overflow, temporarily locking up or ""freezing"" a user's computer, or even executing arbitrary code which could take over a user's computer.

The flaw was discovered and reported by Internet Security Systems, Inc. The upgrade was the second major security fix in less than a month for the browser, which has grown in popularity to ten percent of the browser market in the United States.

Although there were no known exploits of the bug, Chris Hoffman, director of engineering at Mozilla, told reporters, ""because Mozilla is committed to delivering the most secure product possible, we decided to quickly issue an update to patch the bug.""

The Mozilla Foundation did not offer any details about the issue of vulnerability, but a second major security overhaul in such a short time underscores challenges faced by the nonprofit foundation as it goes head-to-head with the market leading Internet Explorer browser by Microsoft.

The new release, Firefox version 1.0.2, ""illustrates the dedication of the strong community of developers working on the product,"" according to Hoffman. ""...we’re able to turn around patches much faster than a traditional corporation,"" he added.

Users can download the update at no charge, and can find additional information at the Mozilla website."
Despite assurances from the European Commissioner for the Internal Market Charles McCreevy that the Council would adopt its controversial Common Position text covering Software,"Patents by the end of 2004, it now looks as if this will not happen until early next year.
Earlier this month, the Council's Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) voted to approve a compromise text on software patents which was agreed between the EU presidency and the European Parliament in June. The JURI vote was expected to be followed by a plenary vote in the full Council before the end of the year, but this has been delayed until January at the earliest.
The delay is due to the fact that the Council is currently preoccupied with other issues","Patents, members voted to restart the entire process with a new directive.

MEP Michel Rocard noted several ""inelegancies"" by the Commission in his speech against the directive, such as not taking into account any of the Parliament's substantive amendments in its recommendation to the Council. He also took the Dutch and German governments to task for ignoring their respective parliaments. The Irish Presidency's sponsorship by Microsoft was also criticised, as were the attempted ratifications at fishery Council meetings.

There was also confusion over the actual effects of the proposed directive with industry players confirming that the Council text allowed pure software patents, while the Commission claimed it would not.

""In the debate, broad agreement prevailed over the fact that the current proposal was counter-productive and far from a good basis for a decision,"" said Italian MEP Monica Frassoni.

The computer-implemented inventions directive was voted down by members of European Parliament (MEP) in the legal affairs committee. 19 MEPs voted in favour of re-starting negotiations, 2 against with one abstention."
"Bobby Abreu, welcome to the spotlight.

The Philadelphia Phillies star, now 31 and a two-time All-Star",", has been one of baseball's most consistent hitters for years. But he's never been in the limelight. Until now.

Abreu is having his best season ever, leading the National League with a .362 batting average as of June 20. He also leads the league in hits (95), runs scored (54) and on-base percentage (.448). And he's second in RBI (50) and slugging percentage (.578).

""I think I'm just getting better,"" says Abreu,",", has produced well for the Phillies over the last half a decade without the glamour of other top players. However, last night there was no denying that he was the star of the show.

And what a show it was. The first batter in the 2005 Home Run Derby, Abreu proceeded to shatter the previous record of 15 home runs in a round, belting 24, including a 517-foot moonshot that exited the stadium in right field, going through two bats in the process. This rampage came immediately after ESPN announcers Chris Berman and Joe Morgan described Comerica Park, the site of the Derby, as a difficult park to hit home runs in.

In the second round, Abreu edged past Boston's David Ortiz (who himself hit an astounding 17 homeruns in the first round) and Milwaukee's Carlos Lee to earn a spot in the finals alongside Detroit star Ivan Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who snuck into the second round with 7 dingers, swatted the most in the second round, but his home-field advantage deserted him in the finals as Abreu smashed 11 over the fences to win the Derby for his native Venezuela.

Abreu's three-round total of 41 homers broke Miguel Tejada's record of 27, set last year in Houston's Minute Maid Park."

"Blogshine Sunday, a national effort among webloggers to publicize the importance of open access to government information is scheduled to take place on March","19th.
Blogshine Sunday was created by the Sunlight Foundation and is being promoted by many blogs including Daily Kos, Talking Points Memo, and The Huffington Post.
The Sunlight Foundation is a non-profit organization that advocates for open government and transparency in politics. They are dedicated to making sure that all Americans have access to their government’s information and records.
The Sunlight Foundation has been working with Congress to pass legislation that would make it easier for citizens to access government documents.
Their efforts have led to the passage of the OP","13, 2005.

On that day, FreeCulture.org will organize web-based writers to relate their experiences and thoughts on open-access to governmental records and freely available public information. Webloggers will be encouraged to highlight the need to have public records available in electronic formats to facilitate easier searching of information and more widespread access. Another goal of Blogshine Sunday is to emphasize that open access to governmental information should be granted to everyone, unpaid reporters and bloggers as well as professional journalists.

Recently, bloggers have played an important role in shaping public opinion about issues that were initially overlooked by traditional media. Freerepublic.com blogger Harry W. MacDougald was the first to scrutinize documents that suggested that President Bush was derelict in his military service in the 1970s. CBS News reported on the documents as if they were legitimate, but MacDougald discovered that the documents used a typestyle that was not available at the time they were supposedly written. Following MacDougald’s blog posts questioning the documents, CBS said that they regretted reporting on the documents as though they were authentic. Since bloggers are generally unpaid and do not have the editorial restrictions of professional journalists, as the MacDougald example illustrates, they are sometimes better able to research and report on issues not covered by traditional media.

Blogshine Sunday is held in conjunction with Sunshine Sunday, when professional journalists and news media will publish articles and editorials on the importance of the open records. Freeculture.org was started last April by two college students in an effort to show that technology can better facilitate public affairs involvement. More information on Blogshine Sunday can be found at: BlogShine.org"

After the verdict she stopped briefly to hug her family before being loaded into a van and driven away.

Corby was arrested at Denpasar Airport last October. On her trip to Bali, she flew from Brisbane to Sydney and then changed planes.

It was claimed that the drugs were being smuggled from Brisbane to Sydney, but for some reason were not removed before her luggage was transferred to the Indonesian flight.

After a lengthy trial that attracted much media attention in Australia, prosecutors called for the judges to hand down a life sentence.

The judge said she had until next Wednesday to appeal."

The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is deploying its new Homeland Security Information Network - Secret (HSIN-Secret) in,"support of the National Response Framework. HSIN-Secret will provide a secure, interoperable communications platform for federal, state and local officials to share information during emergencies and disasters.
HSIP is a DHS program that provides funding to states and urban areas to improve their ability to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established the Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS). This system was designed to help government officials","all 50 state Emergency Operations Centers as well as 18 additional state and local law enforcement sites. ""The secret network is a component of the HSIN, which is the primary conduit for DHS to share information on terrorist threats, suspicious activity and incident management with state, local, tribal and private-sector officials."" reports Government Computer News.

Development on this $350 million system by Northrop Grumman Corporation was begun in March of 2004 with basic operation achieved in just 4 months.

""The Homeland is more secure when each hometown is more secure,"" said Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge in DHS's February 24, 2004 press release that launched the program. ""Future program expansion will include the county level, communication at the classified SECRET level, and the involvement of the private sector."" it continues.

With the ""Secret"" component in place, classified information can now be disseminated to authorized individuals at all levels of government and business throughout the country almost instantly. HSIN lets most government agencies as well as many private companies doing business with the government share information on the whereabouts and suspicious activities of anyone that comes to their attention. Internal policies and the judgement of the system's users provide privacy and civil rights protections, while who can access the system is determined by DHS."
