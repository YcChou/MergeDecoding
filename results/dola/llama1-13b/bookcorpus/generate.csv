I smiled and thought about what he had said. He liked my laugh? That was nice of him. I wondered if he would say something else tomorrow.
When I got home from work the next day there was another note. This one said,","made my way over to gabriel , he was staring at the agent with narrowed eyes and a curled lip .i patted his arm lightly as i passed and was rewarded when my touch dragged his attention away from the other man .i didnt know what it was about liam that had irritated him , and i was too tired to try and figure it out .we left the police department and headed to his car in companionable silence .it wasnt until id settled into the passenger seat of his red 2013 viper that he spoke .what happened ?i thought about lying , but figured the truth was my best bet .if anyone could keep me safe it was evans , even if the reason i was in danger was also his fault ."

Suddenly a voice came from behind them. ""I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that."" The man who had spoken was dressed in black and wore a mask over his face. He held a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other.
""Who are you?"" Fenric asked.
""My name is the Doctor,"" he replied. ""And I'm here to stop you.""
The Doctor looked at the two men. ""You're not going to kill him.""

I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery. It is well written and keeps you guessing until the end.",i was at the clock maker with ramonia .but what did it mean ?i looked at another page and started reading .it was like a play .the stage gets dark as the stagehands change out the sets and props .thats all this was to me now .i was in an overproduced play and couldnt get out .i just hoped the audience liked it .
"the precise number is not what concerns me , though i would suspect with as many children as his grace had , and how many children you and your siblings","have , that it would be a very large number .
What concerns me is the fact that he was so willing to take on such a huge responsibility at such a young age.
I think that says alot about him as a person, and as a man.
He has always been a good father to his children, and they are all well adjusted adults now .
The Duke of York is a wonderful father and I am sure he will make an excellent grandfather.
I'm sure he will be a great grandfather too!
He seems like a lovely man and I wish him and Sarah all the","have had , there would be quite a number .not to mention other branches of eltasi , his graces siblings and cousins and such .the reason i ask is because of the nature of this power that edon wields .what do you know of it ?lady nyeras voice had sharpened all of a sudden , and she leaned forward a little .just then the house major came in to announce that luncheon was ready , but nyera waved him off .we heard no more than rumors , but my son told me that you witnessed it .indeed , and more like it .king edon has acquired this power , and he is not the only one .i personally know of at least three others ."

Suddenly we heard a noise behind us , we turned around and saw a huge white bear coming towards us , he looked very angry , I knew that if he caught up with us we would all die .
I had no time to think about what to do , I just ran as fast as I could , my friends followed me , we were running for our lives .
The bear was getting closer and closer , I could hear his breathing , I could feel his hot breath on my neck , I could smell him ,","howled and the cold only seemed colder .i didnt know how far a hat could travel in that much wind but if it went far i knew we would never find it .i couldnt be killed by a bomb or a surge of water , but i didnt know if i could freeze to death .i had a sinking feeling that i was going to find out soon .12 .the hat and the nomad we went up a small ridge .from the top i saw the most bizarre sight .my heart dropped .there was a forest down there ."

Throughout the day, they had been led through the tunnels and caverns beneath the city, following the wardens directions. They had seen many things, but nothing like what they were looking for. The warden had even taken them into the dungeons, where they saw prisoners being tortured by the guards. It was horrible, but it did not help them in their search.
They had stopped at one point to rest, and the warden had given them some food. He had also told them about the history of the city,","determine how to ( honorably ) force amira to return to callastonhe slowly slipped into the role of bodyguard and man-at-arms , advising them on where the most protected spot was to make camp , or how to avoid dead-ends and chokepoints in towns and villages .it did not help his cause that amira frequently asked his opinion on such matters .sometimes she resorted to suggesting something obviously dangerous , and iris simply did not have the cruelty in him to let the woman make such a blunder .it fascinated dardan to see the full force of his wifes charm turned against another target .dardan didnt feel like he had much role at all now , aside from helping navigate from one town to another .in his youth hed studied maps not only of hedenham county , but the rest of the dukedom of thorncross , as well as neighboring dukedoms .count asmus had said it was important to know nearby lands , but dardan had just thought it was fun poring over the maps , with their odd marks and intricate details .from the city of seawatch they went north to braenar county , whose mazelike crags bordered vasland .iris advised against going deep into the crags in order to search the villages there for mages ; theyd likely run across vaslander raiding parties , which would be nothing but trouble .after braenar they went southwest into vannar county , and then south through youngs county toward the stormrest hills ."
there were no landmarks to signify that this was an important place .no generals calling orders or any way of knowing who these people fought for .,"A few years ago I had the opportunity to visit the battlefield at Gettysburg. It is a very moving experience, and one that I will never forget. The sheer number of men killed in such a short time is staggering.
I have been to Gettysburg twice. Once with my family when I was 12 and once with my wife when we were dating. Both times it was very moving.
The first time I went to Gettysburg was with my parents and sisters. We stayed at a bed and breakfast on the outskirts of town.

He was standing alone, looking out over the crowd. His eyes were dark and intense, but there was something else about them that drew me to him. Something that made me want to know him.
I walked up behind him and placed my hand on his shoulder. He turned and looked at me. I felt like I had been hit by lightning. The attraction between us was so strong, it took my breath away.
He smiled and said hello. We talked for hours that night and I learned that his name was Christian Grey.

Suddenly, she was on top of him and he felt her hands on his chest, pulling at his shirt. He didn’t know what to do. She was so close to him, and he could feel her breathing against his face.

The next day I woke up and my mom was crying and she told me that my dad died last night and that he fell off a cliff while trying to get away from something.

Suddenly, the ship lurched to one side. The crew scrambled to their feet and ran to the railings. A huge wave was coming at them. It crashed into the side of the boat, sending water cascading down the deck.
""Get below!"" shouted Captain Bones. ""We're going to capsize!""
The crew rushed to obey. They were just in time. Another wave hit the ship, this time from the other side. The boat tipped over. Everyone fell into the sea.

Dardan fired his gun at the soldiers that were coming down from the sky. He had no idea how many there were but it seemed like an endless amount.

* lilli and the fairy circle fairy stories of chaveneigh amassed by madame pericolt translated by sir haron w,".
The Fairy Circle is a collection of short stories written by Madame Pericoul, a French author who lived in the 18th century. The book was first published in 1790. It contains six tales: ""The Fairy Circle"", ""The Fairies' Revenge"", ""The Fairy Ring"", ""The Fairy Well"", ""The Fairy Oak"" and ""The Fairy Cave"".
Madame Pericoul (1756-1823) was a French writer. She wrote several novels and short stories for children. Her most famous work","imsee * once upon a time , a handmaiden to the queen of chaveneigh was ill-treated , and she gave birth to a little girl in the wild forest beyond .though she could not help loving the beautiful , blue-eyed girl , she was not allowed her own children in the palace , and so she left the child within a fairy ring , hoping that the mischievous but kind-hearted sprites would take pity on them both .the magic of fairy rings is this : theyre circles of particularly pretty magical mushrooms wherein nothing else may grow .on any given night a flock of fairies , imps , and elves might choose to stage one of their wild parties there deep into the night .the spirits of the forest protect their magical places with great jealousy , however , so the fairy rings are guarded by ferocious toads the size of small deer .the newborn girl , who cried loudly through her first painful , lonely minutes in this new world , was no sooner abandoned by her mother than she was set upon by just such a giant toad .his name was pup-hem-tup , and he croaked at her in displeasure .his eyes bulged as he raised a webbed foot to cover the babes screaming mouth .the little girls fist , thrown about in a tantrum , hit upon the toads bumpy , amphibious skin , and her small fingers closed around him .feeling the warmth of her tiny infant hand , pup-hem-tup let out a plaintive ribbit and lowered himself beside the now-silent little girl , keeping her warm until the fairies arrived at sundown ."

Edon was a great general, but he had no idea what to do with the situation. He knew that if he did not act soon, his army would be destroyed. So he decided to take matters into his own hands. He ordered his men to form up in a circle around him. Then he took out his sword and held it high above his head.
""I am Edon of Dardania,"" he shouted. ""And I will lead you to victory!""
The soldiers cheered loudly. They loved their leader, and they believed in him.
""We are the best warriors","as ever .once , dardans force was almost blindsided by a column of royal infantry who came barrelling out of a side streetbut inexplicably , they had only one mage with them .amira , screaming like a banshee , ran toward him with francine on her heels .between them they killed the mage and cut down half a dozen soldiers before the rest turned and fled .but that stroke of luck did not repeat .dardans legs felt like jelly .theyd crossed half the city evading their pursuers , but where would it end ?the mages said they still saw many silver flashes from the men following them .dardan might not have liams head for numbers , but he could count ."

""We wait..."" He replied.
""Wait for what?"" I asked.
""For him to come back..."" He answered.
""What if he doesn't?"" I asked.
""Then we go in there ourselves..."" He answered.
""And how are we supposed to get past that door?"" I asked.
""You don't..."" He answered.
""What?!"" I exclaimed","undercover .sonya , you can work on the story , but i want you behind the scenes on this thing .if it blows up in our faces , i dont want it to be because you were so green that evans was able to sniff you out .well pair you with someone with some experience , someone who can work under evanss nose and gather information .we may even be able to get some video or photos out of it .if nothing else , an eyewitness account will make whatever we found all the more enticing .fine , sonya snapped , her voice stiff with anger .ill do it ."

"this they did , taking a coach up the central street of seawatch , the salt road , which ran straight as an arrow toward the dukes castle",".
The duke was not in residence at that time , but his guards were there and they were very suspicious of the group of people who had come to visit .
They asked them what their business was , and when they said they wanted to see the duke , they were told he was not there .
""We have come from far away to see him "" they replied , ""and we will wait until he returns "" .
So they waited for three days , and on the fourth day the duke returned .
He was surprised to find so many people waiting for him , and even more surprised when they told","at the highest point of the bluff .amira , dardan , and garen rode in the coach , leaving their horses at the inn , but mason chose to ride hawthorn .the fortress of house eltasi was named winds fury .it was built into the rock of the promontory itself , an angular slab of limestone slotted into sea rocks of a darker gray .narrow window slits rose in a helix up a central , tapering tower .it was imposing and stolid , forbidding beneath the flat gray clouds .in four hundred years it had never been taken by any attacker .the gate guards expected them .amira wasnt sure if they stared at her or mason more .everyone in a big city like seawatch would have seen wardens at least a few times in their lives , but it was still an excitement to meet one up close ."

...and so it came to pass that all ships were painted in bright colors and adorned with elaborate designs ...

Everything turned out well.",and tried to take my leave .he stopped me once again .if you dont know where you are from how do you know where you have to go ?i think ill figure it out .we always think we will .he said as if to a person across the room .i turned but nobody was there .you have been very hospitable but i think i really should take my leave .not until i tell you my story .
at the halfway point i looked up .the door was so close .i had a feeling that if i ran to it i would be able to make,"it.
I'm not sure what I think about this one. It's very short, and I feel like there is more to the story than what we get here. The ending is abrupt and leaves me with questions.
The writing style is good, but I don't know if I can say much else about this piece.",it before anything bad happened .but i couldnt .i chose to take it slow and be vigilant .i moved my right foot carefully and touched down a few inches in front of my left .i then moved my left a little ahead of my right .i attempted to then lift the right but it wouldnt come .i pulled and pulled but i was stuck .to my horror my feet were sinking into the stone floor .
"his secretary , whose name he had never bothered to learn , jerked to a halt .your majesty , good morning , the man said ,","bowing low .
1. your majesty, good morning, the man said, bowing low.","bowing so low that he almost hit his head on the step before him .edon barely slowed to nod at the man , who scurried after him , clutching at a leather folder .the greater council has sent a report about the , er , readiness of your army .it seems the man droned on while edon made his way to the royal dining room , a private chamber meant for meals with his family .no one else was present , and edon did not feel like sending for them .he ate luncheon alone , save for the secretary , who continued babbling about edons schedule , and alice , who sat in a chair by the door , smiling unchastely at edon .the greater council met that afternoon .edon sat in attendance .in some strange way , watching the dukes from the vantage of the throne appealed to him in a way that the council meetings never had as a prince ."
"mama !hush .you , she said , addressing liam .are you what you said you are , to those men ?yes , though","i am not sure how much longer that will be the case.i have been told that my time is short , and that i must find a way to save myself .
Liam nodded, ""I'm sorry."" He looked at her, ""You know I would do anything for you."" She smiled, ""I know."" She looked at him, ""What did they say?"" Liam sighed, ""They said that if I don't get rid of you by tomorrow night, then they will kill me."" She frowned, ""Why?"" Liam shook his head, ""Because I'm","i wish we werent .it might have saved me a beating .were going to take a room at the inn , katin said .do you know the way ?the woman shook her head .the inns burned ."
it was dark ; the only light came from the hallway behind me .there was a television attached to the wall on my right and a white board below,"it.
The room was small, but I could see that there were two beds against the far wall, one of which had been made up. There was a door in the back wall and another door in the left wall. The door in the left wall led into a bathroom with a sink, toilet, and shower stall. The door in the back wall led into a kitchen area with a refrigerator, microwave oven, and a table with four chairs.
I walked over to the bed and sat down on it. It felt comfortable. I looked around the room again.","it .the opposite wall had a lot of openings where things could be plugged in .a chair faced a large window .it was night and nothing could be seen .there was a person sitting in the chair , facing the window .they sat completely still .i went up to the back of the chair .i could feel a sadness emanating from somewhere .are you alright ?"
"katin felt jealousy grasping at her , but she made herself turn away and go out into the cold night .the town seemed not half so","bright as it had been when she came in , and the people were all going home to their warm houses , and she was alone with no one to care for her .
The wind was rising , and the snow began to fall again , and she shivered as she walked along . She had not gone far before she saw a light in a window , and stopped to look at it . It was a little cottage , and there was a fire burning on the hearth , and a woman sitting by it knitting . The room looked very comfortable and cosy , and Katin longed to be inside it , but she","friendly on this trip .shadows lurked , watching her .she encountered no one except a pair of drunken men who whistled at her as she went .she bulled onward , ignoring them .she must have taken a wrong turn , because the street she found herself on didnt look quite familiar .but then there was the square ahead , a torch glowing at each end of the caravan as usual .she must have come at it from another angle .woozy , she stopped in the doorway of an apothecary , powders and potions on display in the window .her head spun with drink and anger ."
"amira asked .she really had no idea what the woman thought .the bear attack must have been terrifying to mari , but like her boys shed","never let it show.
Amira was a little surprised that she hadn't heard of the bear attack, but then again, she wasn't exactly in the loop with everything going on around here. She nodded and smiled at Mari as she spoke about how much she loved her sons. ""I can tell,"" Amira said softly. ""They are very lucky to have you.""
""i know they are...but i dont think they realize that yet,they will one day though...and thank you for saying so...""mari said smiling back at her.
Mari looked down at her hands and",recovered quickly .mari shook her head .you seem honest .i dont see bad in you .what does your husband say ?amira shrugged .he wants me to keep it a secret .but after what happened out there it wouldnt have been fair to keep it from you .
"dardan asked .he bulled aside a city guardsman and leaned against the wall .the guardsman opened his mouth to object ,","but then shut it again.
A few minutes later, he was back in the room with the others. ""I'm sorry, I had to go."" He said. ""But I have some news for you all.""
""What is it?"" Dardan asked.
""The King has been murdered!""
""WHAT?!?!"" The group shouted.
""Yes, but that's not all. It seems that the killer was none other than the Queen herself!""
""No way!"" Dardan exclaimed.
""It's true,"" the man replied. ""She killed","then thought better of confronting two agitated nobles .it must be , she said .there are mages out there , at least .a lot of them .it was hard to count the flashes of silver light , but shed seen at least a dozen so far .liam and katin came up just then , and a few moments later razh and patric followed .count razh gazed out at the soldiers .by the caretaker !"
"it just pisses people off .you shit-eating son of a bitch .rage , rage , rage .the human is angry",".
Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by this.
I think he means that the human is angry because of the way we treat each other and our planet.
I don't know if I agree with him or not but I do understand his point.

Sounds like a good idea. I'm not sure if it would be better to have the story in first person or third, but either way sounds interesting.
I think it would be best in 3rd person.
I'm thinking of making it in 1st person.
I'm thinking of making it in 1st person, because i feel like it will make it more personal.

I","pokmon .dum , dum , dum .i had two options .i could handle this like an adult , or i could open the door and roll out of a moving car .my arm gave a warning twinge , and i decided to go along with it .o-kay ."
"he never looked to see if we were behind him , he simply assumed that we were .the arrogance of him , the sheer ego ,","the self belief was staggering .
The man who had been a hero in his own eyes for so long now knew that he was no longer the centre of attention and it was killing him .
He had always been the one who made the decisions , the one who took the lead , the one who was in control , but now , now he was just another face in the crowd , just another voice shouting out in the darkness .

the people there might have an idea as to where i could find my deepest desire .a couple guards marched back and forth outside the largest tent,",their spears clanking against their shields.
The guard at the entrance looked me up and down, then waved me in with a nod of his head. I walked into the tent and saw a man sitting on a chair behind a table. He was wearing a long robe that covered him from head to toe, but he had a hood over his head so I couldn’t see his face.
“What do you want?” he asked in a raspy voice.
I took a step forward and pulled off my hood. “I am looking for someone,” I said.
He",.i asked for admittance and they let me inside .it was filled with cots while lanterns hung from the ceiling .a group huddled in the corner .they surrounded a large man with a crown .i went right up to him .hello sir .i said pleasantly .who are you ?
