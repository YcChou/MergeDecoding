i could see the mountains in the distance, they were covered in snow.

I saw a UFO in 1986, I was driving home from work at night and noticed a bright light in the sky that seemed to be moving very fast. It was about 20 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be about 50 feet across. It moved in an erratic fashion, sometimes going straight up and then down again. It was not a plane or helicopter because it was too big and too fast. It was also not a star because it was too bright and moved too quickly. I have never seen anything like it since.","up until i could see the ceiling of the cavern coming up fast .i shut my eyes and heard the greatest of bangs .i could not help but look .the monster had jumped straight through the ceiling and we were now outside .we were in the clouds .rain hit me like little needles and the lightning flashed before my eyes , the thunder erupting around us .i felt my hands slipping , giving up to the storm .i could do nothing as i fell through the air except look at the giant fish monster that continued higher and higher ."

i looked around for my friends but they were nowhere to be seen .i walked back to the camp and found it deserted .i went into the tent where we had slept and saw that all our things were gone .i looked around and saw a note on the table .it said ""we are going to find ramonia"" .i knew then that they would not come back .i sat down and cried .

I'm also glad that we're finally going to get a little more insight into what happened between her and the Specter.

I just see us hanging out together","ly .a man came by and made the reservation for you yesterday .he said you should be in sometime after trying on hats .how did that go ?um , it was fine .great .she said even more dully ."

I think we are all aware of the fact that the Church has always been very strict about celibacy for priests. I am sure that there were some who did marry in the past but they were few and far between. The reason why the Church is so strict on this matter is because she knows that if a priest marries he will be less able to give himself totally to God and his people. This is why the Church does not allow married men to become priests.

"this they did , taking a coach up the central street of seawatch , the salt road , which ran straight as an arrow toward the dukes castle","at the top of the hill.
their destination was the old church of st marys, where the body of their beloved father lay in state.
they were met by the local vicar and his wife who had been appointed to look after the funeral arrangements.
the vicar was a tall man with a long face and a long nose, he wore a black suit and a white collar and looked very serious indeed.
he led them into the church and showed them to a pew near the front.
the vicar then went back to the vestry and returned with a large book.","at the highest point of the bluff .amira , dardan , and garen rode in the coach , leaving their horses at the inn , but mason chose to ride hawthorn .the fortress of house eltasi was named winds fury .it was built into the rock of the promontory itself , an angular slab of limestone slotted into sea rocks of a darker gray .narrow window slits rose in a helix up a central , tapering tower .it was imposing and stolid , forbidding beneath the flat gray clouds .in four hundred years it had never been taken by any attacker .the gate guards expected them .amira wasnt sure if they stared at her or mason more .everyone in a big city like seawatch would have seen wardens at least a few times in their lives , but it was still an excitement to meet one up close ."

The first ship to fly the Stars and Stripes was the USS Andrew Doria in 1775. The flag was designed by Francis Hopkinson, who also designed the Great Seal of the United States.
The original design for the flag had thirteen stars arranged in a circle with alternating red and white stripes. This design was changed to a horizontal arrangement of five-pointed stars in a blue field when the number of states increased to sixteen.
In 1818, Congress passed an act establishing the proport","asthead was carved in the shape of a raging boara creature of the dusty rock quarries of baxleyupon its ship the reavelander .the boar became a dreaded sight upon the seas after the ship was seized by raiders during the war of the usurper , whereafter it was sailed against its own people .it was later recovered and destroyed , the memories against it being too strong to forget .another famous masthead belonged to the serpentary , a ship of the dunes portraying two of their infamous sidewinder snakes .the carved pair of reptiles curved around and upon themselves down the length of ship , their rattle-like tails raised in warning on the boats stern .the combatant clans of the desert province used this ship in their own territorial spats , and it was later sailed as a merchant vessel , most likely in the transport of slaves , as suggested by the phrase slave snake .the most famous masthead , however , is likely the turnagains , which was sculpted in the shape of an eagle in flight .the birds wings , representing the power of the illian capital province of quillain , ran out and back , ending in detailed flight feathers halfway down the ships hull .the turnagain , though an actual historic ship , has primarily been remembered as the vessel that carried the hero benson rose in his quest to restore the rightful king to the throne ."
"his golden armor was returned to him , but he would not take it , giving no explanation .amira felt an urge to simply kill him now","and be done with it , but she knew that if she did so, the rest of her team would follow suit.
""I'm sorry for what I have done , but I can't let you go on like this.""
Amira turned to face the man who had just spoken , a young man in his early twenties , with short black hair and dark eyes , he wore a simple white shirt and pants , nothing else , and yet somehow he managed to look very elegant .
""You are the one who has been following me ?""
The man nodded , ""Yes , I am",", but dardan had given his word , and she would not betray that .she held his left hand .his right was maimed ; his little finger had been shortened by one knuckle , and his ring finger by two , by penroses strike .still he wore his plain gold wedding ring on the stump of the finger .penrose had not been seen since that fight .he had probably fled the city and was already on his way back to callaston .somehow , that distant threat loomed over her more than edon , who stood not five yards before her .surrounded by hostile mages , he was harmless .he glared at amira again ."
"i forced my eyes open and saw hundreds of smiling faces clapping and shouting .i stumbled through the crowd , shaking hands and greeting","people.
the next thing i knew, i was in a car being driven to the airport.
my driver was an indian man named raj. he had been driving me around for the last two days, ever since my flight landed at mumbai’s international airport.
“you are very lucky,” he said. “most people never get to see this.”
he was right. we were on our way to the taj mahal.
it was 6:30 am and the sun was just beginning to rise over the horizon.
the taj mahal is one of",people .it was a wonderful sight .i could see for miles .there were streams and fields and even mountains beyond all of that .there wasnt a worry anywhere .a couple of kids came up to me .the boy wore a tunic with a twig belt and the girl wore a dress and they both had blond hair .i shook their hands and they eagerly wanted to hear about my tale .i told them i would tell them but i wanted to get settled first .

I think it's the latter. I don't know what to do about it though.
I've been having this problem for years, and I'm 16 now. It started when I was 12. I have no idea why it happens.

"hard , irrefutable proof , and the only way i was going to get it was if i waltzed back in to lumire and got my","hands on that damn book.
i had no idea what i would do with it once i had it, but i knew i needed it.
and so i did what any self respecting person would do: i went to the library.
the librarian looked at me like i was crazy when i asked for a copy of the book.

""but you must have it!"" i insisted. ""you have every other book in this place! how can you not have this one?""

"thirty minutes later , we were finishing up lunch when he handed me his mastercard and tousled asrais hair in silent farewell .he inclined","his head to the door and left .
I was still sitting there with my mouth open when I heard a car pull up outside.
I looked out of the window and saw him get into a black Mercedes.
He waved at me before driving off .
I watched until he disappeared from sight .
I went back inside and sat down on the sofa .
I had no idea what to do next .
I didn’t know where he lived or how to contact him .
I couldn’t even remember his name .

""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it,"" said the little girl. ""But you are so beautiful and I wanted to see your face.""
The man smiled at her and then reached into his pocket pulling out a small mirror. He handed it to the little girl saying, ""Here, hold this up to your eye and see how pretty you are.""
The little girl took the mirror and looked into it. She gasped with delight as she saw that her reflection was indeed beautiful.

I'm not sure what you mean by that, sara said.
We can't stay here forever, pella said.
Sara looked around the room. It was small and cramped, with only one window, which faced out onto the street. The walls were painted a dull yellow, and there was a large wooden bed in the corner. A dresser stood against the wall opposite the door, and on it sat a few clothes and some books. There was no sign of any other furniture.

""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."" He said. ""But I had to do what I thought was right.""
""What is right?"" I asked. ""To kill someone who has done nothing wrong? To take away their life because they are different from us?""
""It's not about being different,"" he said. ""It's about being dangerous. You could have killed me with your magic. And if you hadn't been stopped by Adrian, you would have killed him too.""

i remember one time when we went to visit our relatives who lived just across the street from us.it was a very hot day and i was playing outside with my cousins.we were all running around and having fun until it started raining.my mom told us to go inside but we refused.so she had to forcefully drag us into the house.
after that,we were not allowed to play outside anymore because of the rain.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have a question about the ""Clockwork Orange"" movie. In the book, Alex is given a choice between being in prison or having his eyes sewed shut. He chooses prison. In the movie, he chooses to have his eyes sewn shut. Why did they change it?

I walked into the room and saw a man sitting in a chair with his back facing me. He had a black shirt on and he was wearing glasses. I sat down next to him and looked at the white board.
""What is your name?"" I asked the man.
""My name is Mr. Smith."" he replied.
""Why are you here?"" I asked.
""I am here because I have been accused of murdering someone."" he said.
