"On Monday, the Israeli army withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Palestinians rejoiced over this occasion, with Mahmoud Abb","as calling it a “victory for peace.”
But what does this mean? What is the significance of Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza?
The answer to these questions lies in understanding the nature of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The conflict is not about land or borders; it is about power. It is about who controls the lives of the people living in the region.
Israel has always been able to control the lives of Palestinians by controlling their land. But now that Israel has withdrawn from Gaza, it no longer has the ability to control the lives of Palest","as saying that ""This is a day of happiness and joy that the Palestinian people have not witnessed for a century.""

The 38 years of Israeli presence in the Gaza strip have officially ended.

Palestinians were overjoyed at the sight of the burning synagogues, planting flags in the midst of it all, and shouting cries of independence. Teenagers set fire to a few synagogues, letting out anger at Israel's occupation.

The fires did little damage to the concrete structures, but Abbas said that the Palestinians planned to destroy them fully.

Palestinian police admitted that there was not much they could or would do to stop this.

Last year, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy the synagogues, but this Sunday, under pressure from religious Jewish organizations, it reversed its decision. Palestinians were angry at the cabinet's Sunday vote.

The synagogues, as well as all community structures, including community centers, schools, and sports facilites, are the only physical remnants of the Israeli Gaza Strip presence since all residential structures have been destroyed."

The announcement was made at a press conference in New York City. The league also announced that the Winter Classic game between the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs will be played outdoors at the Big O in Ottawa on January 1st.
The NHL has been without a collective bargaining agreement since September 15th. The last CBA expired on September 15th.
The NHLPA is expected to meet with the NHL this weekend to discuss the status of negotiations.","has been canceled. The announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days. The dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players. The majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount. The club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million. Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said ""The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.""

This will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded. That year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off."
"German news magazine Der Spiegel reported today that a letter from an extremist Islamic organization calling itself ""Secret Organisation Group of Al-Qaeda of","Jihad in Europe"" was sent to the German embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. The letter threatened Germany with terrorist attacks if it did not withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and Iraq by 23 September.
The letter also warned that the group would attack any country which supported the US-led coalition in Iraq or Afghanistan.

The letter was received at the German embassy on 19 September, but was only made public today","Jihad Organisation"" has appeared, a previously unheard-of organization, claiming responsibility for the explosions in London today. The BBC later released a statement, translated from Arabic, from the group. The text reads as follows:

In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate, may peace be upon the cheerful one and undaunted fighter, Prophet Muhammad, God's peace be upon him.

Nation of Islam and Arab nation: Rejoice for it is time to take revenge against the British Zionist Crusader government in retaliation for the massacres Britain is committing in Iraq and Afghanistan. The heroic mujahideen have carried out a blessed raid in London. Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters.

We have repeatedly warned the British Government and people. We have fulfilled our promise and carried out our blessed military raid in Britain after our mujahideen exerted strenuous efforts over a long period of time to ensure the success of the raid.

We continue to warn the governments of Denmark and Italy and all the Crusader governments that they will be punished in the same way if they do not withdraw their troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. He who warns is excused.

God says: ""You who believe: If ye will aid (the cause of) Allah, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly.

Molson Canada picks up Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. as the company maneuvers to make an entry into the craft beer,"market.
Molson Coors Brewing Company has acquired Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd., a small Ontario brewery that produces premium ales and lagers, for $140 million in cash. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2016.
The acquisition will give Molson Coors access to the Canadian craft beer market, which is growing at a rate of about 30% per year.
“We are excited to welcome Creemore Springs to our family of brands,” said Frederic Landtmeters, president","market.

Creemore Springs of Creemore, Ontario, produces the locally popular Creemore Springs lager. The merger will allow the company to retain its identity.

""The Creemore brand image and brewing craft will remain unchanged,"" Creemore Springs Brewery chairman Bill Wilder said. ""Molson understands and appreciates what is special about the Creemore brand and this makes them a great purchaser for the company.""

Industry observers are mixed on the benefits of the deal for Molson. The CBC reports one analyst suggests Molson may be trying to replicate the success of rival Labatt's premium beers. Others point out the small brewery model does not scale up well, and the attraction of a ""boutique"" beer fades in large-scale production.

Molson Coors Brewing Co., formed by the US$3.4 billion merger in February of two family-run companies, Canadian Molson and U.S. Coors brewing companies, is the fifth largest brewer in the world by volume. ( TSX:TAP.NV, NYSE:TAP)"
The World Health Organisation has announced that the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatments (ART) in developing countries is increasing significantly - more,"than doubling from 1.3 million to 2.7 million between 2004 and 2005.
The WHO said that this was a result of increased access to ART, improved treatment regimens and better monitoring of patients.
However, it warned that there were still many barriers to accessing HIV/AIDS treatment in developing countries.
""There are still significant challenges to overcome,"" said Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO. ""We need to ensure that all those who need treatment can get it.""
She added: ""We must also","than doubling between December 2003 and June 2005. One million people are now getting the drugs they need, compared to just 400,000 eighteen months ago.

However, access to treatment is not growing as fast as demand, and the UN is unlikely to reach its target of treating three million people by the end of 2005 - just over half the people who need it. The longer-term target of universal treatment by 2010 is still likely to be met.

The figures show that the number of people receiving ART is increasing in every part of the globe, but not as quickly as people are contracting HIV. The numbers getting treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, the part of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS has increased threefold on a year ago, and doubled in the last six months. The same rate of growth as also been seen in Asia, the second-worst affected area.

The WHO's report highlights that the best progress has been made when governments have worked together with the WHO, the UN and other parterners. The report goes on to make recommendations for simplifying the process to enable treatment levels to be increased even faster.

The UN's target was based on what was hypothetically possible if all possible steps to provide treatment were taken. The report shows the while financial, political and technical steps have been made, other areas are falling short.

Pressure groups said that countries were reacting too slowly to the pandemic and called on the G8 to provide more sustainable funding for universal treatment for Aids.

UK international development minister Gareth Thompson said: ""We are committed to universal access to HIV treatments by 2010. We will spend £1.5bn in the next three years on Aids, including £150m on orphans."""
A recent survey conducted by the American Cancer Society has turned up some surprising results: Americans generally hold false beliefs about the nature of cancer and its treatment,".
The study, which was published in the journal Cancer, found that 40 percent of respondents believed that cancer is contagious, while 35 percent thought it could be transmitted through casual contact. Another 28 percent said they believe that cancer can be cured with prayer alone.
""These findings are a wake-up call for all of us,"" says Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society. ""We need to do a better job of educating people about what cancer is and how it's treated.""
Braw",", even though many believe they are well informed.

Health experts say this ignorance could be dangerous: People may be making poor health decisions -- avoiding cancer screenings or rejecting potentially life-saving treatments -- based on their incorrect notions.

The most common misconception is that surgery causes cancer to spread. Decades ago, cancer often was not discovered until it was very advanced. At that stage, surgical efforts were rarely successful, and many patients died soon after procedures were performed. This may have given rise to the mistaken belief that the surgeries caused the disease to worsen.

Another commonly held myth is that there is a cure for cancer, but the medical industry is withholding it in order to continue profiting from the sale of less effective treatments and medications.

Believers in this ""conspiracy theory"" may not be guided by it in making their personal health decisions, though. The American Cancer Society says that even though many people are suspicious of the medical industry in general, they have a trusting relationship with their own physicians and are likely to follow their advice.

Almost 20 percent of the people surveyed felt that medications for cancer pain were ineffective.

About 10 percent expressed the belief that cancer could be cured with a positive attitude alone, while a similar number felt that there was no effective treatment for cancer.

The fact is, cancer survival and treatments -- including pain management -- have vastly improved in the last thirty years.

Results of the survey appear in the August 1 issue of Cancer, a journal published by the American Cancer Society."

Iraq has carried out the first executions since the demise of the Saddam Hussein regime. Three men convicted of murder were hanged,"in Baghdad on Monday, and a fourth was executed in Basra.
The three men were hanged at dawn in Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison. The fourth man was hanged in Basra.
The executions came after the government announced last week that it would resume capital punishment for the first time since 1960.
Iraqi officials say they are determined to restore law and order in the country, which has been plagued by violence since the US-led invasion in March 2003.
But human rights groups have condemned the move","on Thursday morning in Baghdad.

Iraqi president Jalal Talabani is personally opposed to capital punishment and stated that he would never sign a death sentence, not even against Saddam Hussein himself. His deputy Adel Abdel Mehdi signed the warrant instead.

Human rights groups and the United Nations had hoped Iraq would refrain from using the death penalty against its citizens and urged the government not to carry out the sentences.

&amp;ndash; According to The Times, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom The Right Honourable Anthony Charles Lynton Blair wants to make it easier for British citizens to get a passport.
The paper reports that Mr. Blair is considering scrapping the current system whereby applicants must prove their identity by producing a birth certificate or other documentary evidence. Instead, he is said to be looking at introducing a new system whereby people would have to provide only one piece of information to confirm their identity.
The newspaper says that this","involve the United States of America in efforts to reduce anthropogenic interference with Earth's climates. Historically, the United Kingdom's closest partner in this endeavor has been the Federal Republic of Germany. The United States government has famously refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Blair sais also that the Kyoto Protocol doesn't go far enough. He would like to involve the private sector also and he has put this item on top of the G8, so all the large countries of the world have to talk about it.

Brazil is threatening to break the patent of US-based Abbott Laboratories as it pushes ahead with its programme to supply its people with,"cheap generic drugs.
The country's health ministry has said that it will not renew Abbott's patent on a drug called Norvir, which is used to treat HIV/AIDS patients.
The move comes after the government announced plans to cut the price of the drug by 90% in order to make it more affordable for poorer Brazilians.
""We are going to take steps to ensure that this medicine is available at an affordable price,"" said Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao.
He added: ""This is a very important step forward in","free AIDS drugs.

Brazil has given Abbott a deadline of July 7 to cut the prices of its drug Kaletra or a Brazilian company will begin cloning it. This move would test recent World Trade Organization concessions allowing poor countries to produce generic drugs for local health emergencies.

Abbott has said that Brazil's demand goes ""against the spirit"" of the WTO agreement, since it has the ninth largest economy in the world, and that this could damage future research for improved treatments.

Previous programmes have been negotiated between companies and governments to produce generic versions of AIDS drugs, but this is the first time a country has threatened to use powers negotiated at the WTO by producing the drug without the cooperation of the patent holder.

Several campaign groups are supporting the move, hoping that other developing countries will be able to take the lead of Brazil and produce generic drugs for their own populations. Michael Bailey, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam International, said: ""The impact of breaking the patent would be enormous. If a major country such as Brazil goes through with this, not only will it help ensure sustainability of their excellent treatment programme, it will set a hugely important precedent for other countries.""

The US Chamber of Commerce has issued a statement urging Brazil to reconsider and suggesting that the move could create a rift between the countries. Thomas Donohue, Chamber President and CEO said: ""Brazil’s threat to strip patent rights from a U.S. company should concern all investors and every business around the world because of the precedent it sets for the treatment of intellectual property."""
Millions of origami cranes have been dropped on Thailand's three southern provinces following violence between the government and ethnic minority Muslim populations,".
The cranes, which are a symbol of peace in Japan, were sent by Japanese people to show their support for the Thai government's efforts to end the violence.
""We hope that the cranes will bring peace to the region,"" said Yasushi Akashi, who is leading a group of 100 Japanese volunteers in Thailand.
Akashi said he hoped the cranes would be displayed at the Japanese embassy in Bangkok.
Thailand has been hit by a wave of bombings and shootings since January, when the government launched an off",". The move has been called a ""goodwill gesture"" towards Muslims.

Up to 120 million such paper sculptures were dropped on Thailand's three southern-most provinces, Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. Tensions in this area have increased recently, peaking with the recent death of 85 demonstrators arrested during a protest. The government blamed their deaths on physical weakness due to fasting in the month of Ramadan as the cause, as most if not all the deaths occurred during transport of up to 500 arrested protestors. Critics of the Thai government have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, blaming the ""over-eagerness"" of Thai security forces as the cause of the deaths.

The dispersal was timed to coincide with the birthday of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and has generated much interest from the rest of the country's predominantly Buddhist population.
The cranes were built by citizens throughout Thailand and had peace messages written on them. The southern, Muslim provinces are often considered neglected by a north that is larger and of the majority ethnic group. Some have welcomed the goodwill gesture, but critics in both the north and south have said that the resources would have been better spent solving the problems in the south. Some Islamic leaders in the south have also expressed concerns that the gesture may not be properly understood by Muslims, as the crane carries no cultural significance with them."
"In the wake of a United States Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. New London on eminent domain last week, a California man has proposed","a new way to protect property owners from government seizure: a constitutional amendment that would require a two-thirds vote of Congress and state legislatures before any land could be taken for private use.
The idea is not without precedent. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution already requires that private property may only be seized by the government ""for public use."" But the amendment's language does not specify what constitutes ""public use,"" leaving it up to the courts to decide.
In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Berman v.","that Justice David Souter's New Hampshire home be seized by the state and a hotel be built on the site. Logan Darrow Clements faxed a letter to town officials in Weare, New Hampshire June 28, 2005 that justified the action as such:

""The justification for such an eminent domain action is that our hotel will better serve the public interest as it will bring in economic development and higher tax revenue to Weare.""

Justice Souter, who was in the majority ruling in the Kelo case, has lived at the farmhouse in Weare since he was 11 years old. Clements indicated that it was necessary to build on that location because ""it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans."" The action has given rise to a great deal of support nationwide, as many are writing to the councilors of the small town of Weare to voice their approval for the proposal.

The proposal for the ""Lost Liberty Hotel"", as it is to be called, features a number of components which seem to focus on the libertarian leanings of its designer. A dining room, called the ""Just Desserts Cafe"" and a museum based on the ""loss of freedom in America"" are two such components. Instead of a Bible provided by the Gideons (a standard item placed in most American hotel rooms), each guest will receive a free copy of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged."
People all over the Netherlands are voting today in a referendum on the EU constitution. This the first national referendum for two hundred years and it is non,"-binding, but the government has promised to take note of the result.
The Dutch have been asked to vote Yes or No to the following question: ""Do you agree that the European Union should adopt the new treaty?""
The Dutch government has said that if the majority votes yes, then the treaty will be ratified by parliament. If the majority votes no, then the government will consider whether to go ahead with ratification anyway.
The Dutch prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende has said that he would not resign if the Dutch reject the treaty. He says that the Dutch people have spoken and that the government","-binding. Though most major political parties have stated they will abide by the referendum if the outcome is sufficiently clear and a large enough percentage of the voters have actually voted.
The question put to voters will be:

:Bent U voor of tegen instemming door Nederland met het verdrag tot vaststelling van een grondwet voor Europa?
:""Are you for or against approval by the Netherlands of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe?""

All the main political parties have asked for a voor (for, or yes) vote. However polls have been saying that two-thirds of the people will be voting tegen (against, or no).

One reason for people to vote no is the expansion of the European Union with large countries like Turkey, which they fear will cause less influence for the smaller countries. The view of an European super state in which the Netherlands would loose its own identity is another reason for voting no. Some of the no voters do this to show they don't agree with the current political situation and the supposed risen prices since the introduction of the euro.

As of 14:00 CET, 9% more voters had turned up for the referendum than for the European elections.

She said afterward that she had urged the Iraqis to take steps to reduce sectarian violence",", Samir Sumaidaie, declared to reporters that the international body of the United Nations helped the regime of Saddam Hussein. This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's Oil-for-Food program with Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali although there is no charge against him in the report.

In an interview with Voice of America reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie said: ""In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later.... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program.""

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.

After being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said: ""Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him.""

On Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: ""We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it."""
"Bitmover, the company producing a management program for computer source code named Bitkeeper (BK), announced on April 5 that it will no longer","sell BK to Japanese customers.
The reason is that the company has been unable to obtain a license from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) for its patented technology. The JPO rejected Bitmover's application in February this year.
Bitmover had applied for a patent for BK in 1997 and received approval in 2000. However, the JPO rejected the application again in 2003 because of a technical problem. In response, Bitmover filed an appeal with the Intellectual Property High Court in 2004.","be providing a free version of its product.

As a result of Bitmover's announcement, the programmer who wrote the original Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds, stated on a mailing list that he ""decided to not use BK mainly because he needs to figure out the alternatives"". As to an alternative to Bitkeeper, Torvalds hinted that he is considering Monotone but that Subversion, a recent replacement for CVS, is out of the running. Bitkeeper was originally developed to allow Torvalds to manage code contributions more easily, according to Jeremy Andrews at Kerneltrap.org, and was previously provided to kernel developers free of charge, though it was restricted in its use.

Bitkeeper is the software that Torvalds and hundreds of other Linux developers use to manage submissions of code to the Linux kernel, the heart of the computer operating systems referred to as ""Linux"" or ""GNU/Linux"". Linux is distributed in many different forms, bundled with other software by companies such as Red Hat, Novell, and Linspire.

While the details are not clear, it appears from Andrews' article that Bitmover's decision to stop releasing the free version of Bitkeeper is related to a dispute with Torvalds' employer, Open Source Development Labs (OSDL).

According to Kerneltrap, an OSDL contractor had been reverse engineering the free version of Bitkeeper in order to make an open source replacement, which is prohibited by the license under which the free version of Bitkeeper is released. Nevertheless, Torvalds notes in his post that he is ""personally very happy with BK, and with Larry McVoy, the CEO of Bitmover."""

Australia needed to win to force a 2-2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give them to England, ending 18 years and eight series of Australian dominance. In the end, England managed to bat out the final day, and a draw ensured the Ashes were coming back to England.

Kevin Pietersen and Ashley Giles hit personal bests of 158 and 59 respectively, to bat out the best part of the last day. Pieterson's 158 was his maiden test century, and included 7 sixes. Early in the day, Australia looked to be in with a chance of winning the match, with early wickets leaving England at 67 for 3. Giles and Pietersen's century partnership, though, left Australia with no hope of catching England in the remains of the day, sealing England's Ashes win since 1987.

England's next Tests will be an away series in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the world champions Australia will play an ICC World XI (which inclues Kevin Pietersen, Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff) in the Johnnie Walker Super Series in early October."
Space.com reported yesterday on a picture of a planet taken by the Very Large Telescope located in Chile. The European Southern Observatory's,"VLT is one of the world's largest optical telescopes, and it has been used to take pictures of planets orbiting other stars.
The planet was discovered by a team led by Michel Mayor of the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland. It is about 10 times as massive as Jupiter, but only half as wide. It orbits its star at a distance of about 50 million miles (80 million kilometers), which is much closer than Mercury orbits the Sun.
The planet is called OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb,","telescope, which was used to capture the picture, has made the first confirmed discovery of a planet orbiting another star.

Scientists have been trying to locate planets outside our own solar system for nearly 10 years. Inferences of nearly 150 planets in other solar systems have been observed so far by using instruments and measurements that only suggest the existence of another planet. Until now, no planet has been confirmed by the means of a photographed image. There was, months earlier, another team of scientists who took pictures of what might be another planet, but that image remains controversial because it shows what may be an even more distant object instead.

The research team that photographed the planet with its host star was led by Ralph Neuhaeuser of the Astrophysical Institute &amp; University Observatory (AIU). ""The detection of the faint object near the bright star is certain,"" he told Space.com on Friday.

The new image contains the star, GQ Lupi, with an orbiting planet. It is smaller than our sun, 70% the size, and is located 400 light-years away from our solar system. The planet is nearly twice the size of Jupiter. Unlike our sun which is 4.6 billion years old, the GQ Lupi star is approximately 1 million years old and is considered very young for a star. The planet orbiting GQ Lupi is three times further out than Neptune's orbit around our sun, and scientists estimate the orbiting period to be about 1,200 years. The planets wide orbiting distance from the GQ Lupi was an important element for enabling the photograph to be taken.

The planet, much like the star it orbits, is very hot &amp;mdash; about 2,000 degrees Kelvin &amp;mdash; so despite the detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, which at that temperature would make it gaseous, there is no expectation it might support life.

The discovery will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics."
"Young Quakers who planned to take part in the World Gathering of Young Friends at Lancaster University, England have been unable to attend after having","their visas refused.
The group was due to leave for the UK on 25 July but were told by the British Embassy in Beirut that they would not be granted entry into the country.
The young people had applied for visas through the embassy’s website and were told that they would receive them within a week. However, when they arrived at the embassy to collect their visas they were told that they had been refused.
“We are very disappointed,” said one of the young people, “we feel we have done everything right.”
The group is now trying to","their visas denied.

Their absence has been a cause of ""hurt"" at the meetings. Sara Wolcott of Pacific Yearly Meeting on the Western coast of America wrote in a journal on the WGYF website: ""I saw in a workshop for Friends planning to meet in Kenya how much the absence of so many Friends was felt; the gathering felt incomplete. We desperately wanted our brothers and sisters to be with us, I know they wanted to be here too.""

Most of the denials were for economic reasons, if someone doesn't have a high enough income or a fixed job it can be assumed that they will stay in the country for work. Representatives from the gathering now plan to go to Kenya in October to share some of the programme with those who were unable to come.

Despite the missing Friends, the gathering has brought together a mix of different Quaker traditions in a positive atmosphere that has been appreciated by participants. Many Quakers worship in silence (unprogrammed meetings) while others, particularly in America and Africa, have ministers like other churches. Quakers also have differences of opinion over theological issues, including even the existence of God, but the young Friends have not found this to be an obstacle to coming together. Unlike many traditional Christian sects, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, encourage each member to explore his or her own relationship with God.

Chrissy Muhr of Northwest Yearly Meeting (Northwest US) wrote: ""I've been really impressed by how the mix of worship styles has been handled. Almost all the programmed Friends I've spoken to have some prior experience of unprogrammed worship. For me, the hardest thing has been not falling asleep during long periods of silence - the long week has begun to take its toll."""
A new redesigned US $10 bill was introduced at a ceremony yesterday on Ellis Island. The new bill adds three new background colors; red,", blue and green.

The new bill will enter circulation in October of this year.",", yellow and orange. It continues to feature Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. The $10 bill is the third US bill to switch from the traditional green. The $20 and $50 bills were redesigned to feature color within the past two years.

The improvements in digital technology have made it much easier for counterfeiters. ""Ten years ago, 1 percent of (counterfeit) bills were produced on digital equipment. These days, 56 percent are produced on digital equipment, and the technology is more accessible to the general population,"" said Eric Zahren, spokesman for the Secret Service.

According to the Treasury Department, to be able to keep ahead of counterfeiters currency will need to continue to be updated every seven to ten years. The $10 bill was last redesigned in 2000. ""The intention was not to create a counterfeit-proof note&amp;mdash;which is basically impossible&amp;mdash;but one that's harder to duplicate and easier to authenticate,"" said Zahren. This new bill includes many new and enhanced security features such as color-shifting ink, a watermark, microprinting and a security thread

Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said in a statement ""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. Government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure."" The new $10 bill is expected to go into circulation in early 2006."

"House Democrats called for an investigation into possible voting fraud and irregularities during the 2004 U.S. presidential election, according","to a letter sent to Attorney General John Ashcroft on Thursday.
The letter was signed by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, and Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), ranking member of the committee.
""We believe that there is substantial evidence of voting machine malfunctions in Ohio,"" the letter said. ""We also believe that these problems may have affected the outcome of the election.""
Waxman and Conyers asked Ashcroft to investigate whether any laws were broken during the election. They also requested information about","to a Dec. 23 letter from House Representative David Wu (D-OR).

Thousands of Ohio citizens have reported experiencing problems casting their votes due to long lines at polling places, malfunctioning voting machines, inexplicable numbers of votes cast, and disenfranchisement in urban areas.

""The integrity of our democracy is at stake. We need to give the American people confidence that each and every vote will be properly counted and that the democratic electoral process is respected,"" Wu said. ""I also understand concerns about the conflict of interest of having an official in charge of running elections in a key state also heading a presidential campaign. I agree that Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell's dual role calls into question any election decision he made that favored Republicans.""

Other Congressmen including John Conyers (D-MI), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and Robert Wexler (D-FL) voiced similar concerns, and requested an investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), citing specific cases in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, and California.

In December, Conyers, the Ranking Democrat on the House Committee on the Judiciary, issued a series of letters about voting irregularities to the media, campaign officials, and manufacturers of voting equipment. These letters seek to collect and preserve information regarding the conduct of the election.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office previously reported on voting irregularities in eariler presidential elections.

A September 14, 2004 GAO report on the 2000 presidential elections detailed changes the DOJ implemented to try to ensure voter access to polls, and the importance of monitoring election-day activities.

"A Romanian student officer on mission in Iraq, Major Robertino Ciobanu, was wounded on Sunday by a bullet fired unintentionally","by an American soldier.
The incident occurred at the US military base of Camp Taji, 20 km northwest of Baghdad, where the Romanian contingent is stationed.
Major Ciobanu was hit by a bullet that came from a weapon belonging to an American soldier who was cleaning his rifle. The bullet went through the Romanian's right arm and exited through his left shoulder.

Representatives of both the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) signed a peace pledge today in the,"presence of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
The agreement, which was reached on 27 August, is aimed at ending the conflict between the two parties that has lasted for more than 50 years.
""This is an historic day,"" Mr. Ban said after signing the document with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and SPLM leader Salva Kiir Mayardit. ""I am confident that this agreement will bring peace to the people of Sudan.""
Mr. Ban also welcomed the decision by the African Union (AU) to deploy a force of","Kenyan capital Nairobi, under the watchful eye of United Nations ambassadors.

According to the BBC, the document concluded with a memorandum saying that ""prompt completion of the peace process is essential for all the people of Sudan"". The actual peace treaty should, according to the pledge, be signed no later than December 31st 2004. While the pledge focuses mainly on the fights between the rebels in the south and the Khartoum-based government in the north, there is also attention for the ongoing crisis in east Sudan (Darfur).

Several aid agencies have criticized the UN for taking a weak stand against the Sudanese government. The Security Council has already signed two resolutions threatening economic sanctions against Sudan if the government does not disarm its troops in Darfur, but, so the BBC reports, the violence is continuing. The civil war in Darfur was sparked in 2003, when insurgents started attacking government buildings. The Arab government in Khartoum subsequently sent troops to the region, which have been reported to mass-violate human rights of the black Africans living in Darfur."
"In anticipation of a Security Council vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the International Criminal Court, Sudan announced today it would reject","any such court.
The announcement came as the United Nations Security Council was considering a resolution that would refer the case to the ICC in The Hague.
Sudan's Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said his country would not accept the jurisdiction of the ICC and would not cooperate with its investigations.
""We will not allow this court to interfere in our internal affairs,"" he told reporters in Khartoum. ""We are ready to defend ourselves against any aggression.""
Ismail said Sudan had already rejected the idea of an international tribunal","any United Nations resolution that required war crimes suspects to be tried abroad. The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the French delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week.

Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, ""Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese &amp;mdash; whether he is a rebel or government official &amp;mdash; outside the Sudan: we are totally against it."" In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group ""Justice and Equality of Movement,"" said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace.

Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to human rights abuses in Darfur. Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts.

The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias. It has often been suggested that this qualifies as genocide, and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights."

"Last night, CNN's Anderson Cooper played a chilling police audio tape of a 1991 confession made by the accused killer","in the case of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham.
The suspect, Jesse Matthew Jr., was arrested last week and charged with abduction with intent to defile in connection with the disappearance of Graham, who vanished on September 13 after leaving a bar near campus.
Matthew is also a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, whose body was found in an abandoned field about 10 miles from where Graham disappeared.
In the 1991 recording, Matthew admits to killing a woman named Crystal Gail Mang","of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford. On the tape, John E. Couey is heard admitting to molesting a young girl in her own backyard. For the crime he was subsequently charged, convicted and imprisoned for 2 years.

An accompanying written report by the officer who took the taped confession says; ""Couey admitted that this was not the first child he had ever touched, however, this is the first time he was caught."" The officer continues, ""Couey admitted to molesting his wife's daughter, however, she agreed not to report the incident if he left the house and gave her a divorce, which he did."" CNN was unable to locate Couey's former wife.

The revelation calls into question the way Couey has been dealt with by officials over the years. He spoke on the 1991 tape about how he ""needs help"" and ""wants help"".

Mary Doyle, a Citrus County probation official, said Monday that if they had known Couey was a registered sex offender, they may have been able to keep him away from Jessica Lunsford. Florida Courts do not provide probation workers with criminal backgrounds of their probationers, even in the case of registered sexual offenders like Couey, Doyle said. With that information they might have tried harder to locate him when he failed to report in with probation officials last November. When detectives did finally catch up with him, they learned he had been living across the road from Jessica."
Australians and New Zealanders throughout the world stood still for their national war memorial days in remembrance of the failed Australian and New Zealand Army Corps,"(ANZAC) landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.
The ANZACs were part of a British-led force that landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula to capture Constantinople, now Istanbul, from the Ottoman Empire during World War I. The campaign was intended to be a bold stroke that would knock Turkey out of the war, but it ended up lasting eight months with heavy casualties on both sides.
In Australia, Anzac Day is commemorated each year on 25 April. It marks the anniversary of the","&amp;mdash; ANZAC &amp;mdash; attack on Gallipoli, Turkey that began on 25 April 1915. The fateful attack was designed to end the First World War more quickly by creating a supply line to Russia. A hundred-thousand died in the battle, remembered every year as ANZAC Day by both nations.

The British-directed battle of Gallipoli is often seen as the defining moment in the 'birth' of Australia and New Zealand. With New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark saying ""For New Zealand as for Australia it was at Gallipoli that our young nations came of age."" . This being the 90th anniversary of the attack, Clark, Australian Prime Minister John Howard and Britain's Prince Charles are all at Gallipoli to remember that fateful campaign.

Some controversy has been created about Australian Prime Minister John Howard not attending the New Zealand ceremony at Chunuk Bair on the Gallipoli Peninsula. This has upset many people as it is a break in a tradition that the Prime Ministers attend the ceremonies of both countries."

The U.S. military has been trying to persuade farmers to grow other crops instead of poppies, which are used to make heroin. But the Taliban have stepped up their attacks on government officials and security forces in recent months, making it difficult for them to carry out such programs.
""We are not able to do our work,"" said Mohammad Daud Daud, head of the provincial council in Helmand province. ""They (the Taliban) are threatening us.""
Afghanistan is the world's","'s supply. Opium may account for one-third of Afghanistan's GDP.

On Sunday's CNN's Late Edition, Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai laid the blame for the explosion of opium production in his country at the feet of the US and Britain. ""This particular operation in Kandahar or in other parts of the country, which have not been so successful, was supposed to be done by an agency, a department that was funded by the international community, by the United States, by Britain. The failure is theirs, not ours."" Kazai said. ""Where international money and creation of forces for destruction of poppies was concerned, it was ineffective and delayed and half-hearted.""

Karzai was responding to allegations in Sunday's New York Times that his government was dragging their heels in reducing the opium production in Afghanistan. In Kandahar Province last week, farmers were visible from the main road scraping the last resin from poppy plants. That location is just 10 minutes outside the provincial capital."

"The Senator Julian McGauran in the Australian Senate had made an ""unseemly"" gesture across the floor of the Senate whilst it was in session",".
The incident occurred on 15th June 2006, when Senator McGauran was speaking during a debate on the Government's proposed changes to the Work Choices legislation.
Senator McGauran was making his contribution to the debate and was gesturing with his hands as he spoke.
During this time, Senator McGauran made an unseemly gesture across the chamber towards the Opposition Leader, Senator Stephen Conroy.
The incident was captured by the ABC's live coverage of the proceedings.
The incident was reported to the President of the Senate","on August 11, apparently as a result of interjections about a division taking place.

Whilst this was not immediately debated, Senator Bob Brown had asked the Acting Deputy President of the Senate to look into the matter. Later the President of the Senate ruled that the gesture was ""unseemly but not obscene"".

This ruling caused a fierce debate, with Senator Brown saying that McGauran's ""arrogant and disgusting"" actions exemplified the Government's attitude towards its new-found Senate majority, whilst Senator Ron Boswell, the National Party Senate leader, had criticised Brown of hypocrisy, stating that Brown had ""broken every law in Australia"" and ""every law in Tasmania"" (which Bartlett noted as a point of order as being hyperbole).

Senator McGauran then spoke, stating that he ""regretted his actions"". Brown however noted that this was not an unqualified apology. A motion was then put that the President's ruling be dissented from, which debate was set for another sitting. Senator Chris Evans, the Labor Senate leader and Senator Brown had called for McGauran's sacking as Chief Government whip; his National Party superiors have said that they will speak to McGauran about the incident."
A section of the rail tunnel outside Gerrards Cross Station in Buckinghamshire collapsed at around 8 p.m. last night. No-,"one was injured, but the incident has caused major disruption to services on the West Coast Main Line.
The collapse is believed to have been caused by a landslide, and Network Rail engineers are currently working to clear the debris from the track. The line will remain closed until further notice.
A spokesman for Network Rail said: “We can confirm that a small section of the railway embankment near Gerrards Cross station has collapsed. We are working with our contractors to clear the site as quickly as possible.
“This is likely to cause significant delays and cancellations to trains","one was injured. 20 metres of concrete tunnel and gravel collapsed onto the Chiltern to Marylebone line, closing the railway and causing much disruption.

The tunnel was created by the supermarket chain Tesco, who had filled in a railway cutting in order to build a supermarket above it. The project was unpopular both among the local community and the rail industry who felt the project put commercial gain before railway safety.

The accident came hours after another rail accident in East Yorkshire, where a train collided with a car at a level crossing, killing the driver of the car and injuring five train passengers."
Reuters reports that nine people have died from Ebola in the Republic of Congo this month. The outbreak is in the Cuvette-,"Ouest region, which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
The DRC has been battling an outbreak since August 2018 and has recorded more than 2,000 cases and over 1,400 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday it was sending a team to the area to investigate the outbreak.

The virus can be found in the saliva of an infected animal when it bites another animal or human. Once the virus enters the body, it travels along nerves to the brain where it multiplies and causes inflammation. This leads to paralysis and death.
The rabies virus is found in the sal","last week a teenage girl named Jeanna Giese was released from a hospital having been successfuly treated. She became the first known person to recover from the disease without vaccination.

On September 12, 2004, Jeanna &amp;mdash; a 15 year old from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin&amp;mdash; was bitten by a bat while attending church. By the time she saw a doctor about fatigue and numbness, it was October 18, and the bat incident was not brought up until several days later. Usually when there is a possibility of rabies, doctors will vaccinate patients: the vaccine has a chance to act before the symptoms appear. In Jeanna's case it was too late to try to vaccinate, and her doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin devised a new treatment. Jeanna was put into a drug-induced coma for a week, and doctors began an intensive treatment to prop up her nervous system until her natural immunity recovered enough to fight the disease.

By surviving and recovering, Jeanna became the only person known in medicine to overcome rabies without a vaccine. She is not yet fully recovered: the effects of the coma are still apparent, and she has difficulty with movement. Yet the doctors believe that she is getting well much faster than they expected, and feel that Jeanna will be able to return to her high school studies, needing only physical and occupational therapy.

The novel treatment is hailed by doctors as promising, but needs analysis and verification on another human. Jeanna's is the sixth case of human recovery from a rabies infection, but the other five people were vaccinated against rabies either before infection, or before the symptoms appeared."

Margaret Pardoel, mother of the first Australian soldier to be killed in Iraq since the commencement of hostilities, has expressed anger over the government's decision to send more troops to the war-torn country. She said that she was ""disgusted"" by the move and that it would only make matters worse.
The 52-year-old woman from Sydney said that her son, Private Jake Kovco, had been a good man who had died for nothing. She also said that she","death of her only son, a father of three, who was about to return home to Australia and had been planning a career change. Mrs Pardoel and husband John were devastated by the loss of their only son.

Mrs Pardoel said she opposes the war. ""I think it's just cold-blooded murder. Look at all those young American boys that have been slaughtered,"" she said. ""I don't think this should have gone on ... He said to me one night he phoned, he said, 'Mum there's nowhere to hide here, it's just so dangerous, there's nowhere to hide'.""

Thirty-five year old Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel had been on his last flight when the C-130 Hercules he was aboard crashed north of Baghdad yesterday, killing ten personnel. He was serving with the British Royal Air Force (RAF), to which he had transferred several years ago from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), as Navigator in 47 Squadron Lyneham RAF.

Mr Pardoel had been expecting to return in July to his wife and three children in Australia, where they had recently bought a new house in Canberra.

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, says he is saddened to hear of the man's death.

""I want his family to know, and his friends to know, that he certainly did not die in vain, that this tragic accident occurred - or this tragedy because it may not have been an accident - but this tragedy occurred on a day when 65 per cent of the people of Iraq went out and voted,"" he said."
"Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found","in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana. The discovery was made by researchers from North Carolina State University and the University of Texas at Austin.
The fossilized remains were discovered in 2013 and are believed to be around 68 million years old. The scientists used CT scans to examine the bones and found that they had been preserved in a way that is not typical for dinosaur bones.
“We’ve never seen this before,” said Lindsay Zanno, paleontologist at NC State and lead author of a paper describing the findings. “It’s","in a sandstone formation in Montana.

MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science.

Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. “Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.”, paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Richard A. Hengst of Purdue University said the finding ""opens the door for research into the protein structure of ancient organisms, if nothing else. While we think that nature is conservative in how things are built, this gives scientists an opportunity to observe this at the chemical and cellular level.""

Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said the discovery was ""pretty exciting stuff."" ""You are actually getting into the small-scale biology of the animal, which is something we rarely get the opportunity to look at."""
"Speaking in Texas, President Bush in a Wednesday address to the American Legislative Exchange Council in the city of Grapevine said, ""","I'm here to talk about an issue that is very important to me and to our country. I'm here to talk about education.""
The president went on to say, ""We need to make sure every child can read and write and add and subtract. We need to make sure every child has the skills necessary to succeed in life. And we need to do it without spending more money.""
Bush then outlined his plan for improving public schools by giving parents more choices in where their children are educated. He also called for more charter schools, which are privately run but receive public funding.","The violence in recent days in Iraq is a grim reminder of the enemies we face.""

""After September the 11th, I made a commitment to the American people that the United States of America will not wait to be attacked again."" Bush said. ""We will take the fight to the enemy, and we will defend our freedom.""

There has been debate within the Administration as to how to refer to the ongoing conflict. In recent appearances, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has avoided using the word ""war"", preferring the phrase ""global struggle against violent extremism."" Bush's speech marks a return to the existing phrase ""war on terror"". In the speech he acknowledged that the struggle is against those who use terror to achieve their goals, implicitly recognising that the term ""war on terror"" may be misleading.

""Make no mistake about it, this is a war against people who profess an ideology, and they use terror as a means to achieve their objectives,"" he said.

Of the military strategy in Iraq, Bush said that coalition forces continue to hunt down terrorists, and the Iraqi security forces are being trained to take on more responsibility. ""As Iraqis stand up, Americans and coalition forces will stand down,"" Bush said. ""And we're making progress. More and more Iraqi units are more and more capable of defending themselves.""

The return of American forces to U.S. soil will be event-driven decision, he said. A timetable for withdrawal is not practical because it would give the enemy a tactical event upon which to plan.

Politically, Iraq's National Assembly is working on a constitution that members pledged to have ready by August 15. The Iraqi people would then vote on the constitution October 15. If passed, the new Iraqi government under a constitution would be elected December 15.

The choice of Wolfowitz is raising controversy in Europe and developing nations. Known as hawkish and outspoken, Wolfowitz was a pro-Iraqi war neo-conservative in his role as deputy Secretary of Defense, and a chief architect in the build up to war with Iraq. Some question whether Wolfowitz, who was criticized for brushing aside European and NATO calls for caution before the Iraq war, would use the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as tool to extend U.S. foreign policy interests.

Historically, it has been the White House’s prerogative to name the candidate because the U.S. holds a majority on the 24 member board, but board members from nations other than the U.S. are seeking their own interviews to qualify the candidate before a change is made. ""The executive directors have agreed to conduct informal meetings over the coming days with the US nominee as part of the consultative process."" the IMF said in a statement. ""Thereafter, the executive directors will meet in a formal session to select the president at which time an official announcement of the outcome will be made,"" it said.

In a letter to President Bush, Kerik explained that the immigration status of a housekeeper and nanny, as well as nonpayment of income tax on the housekeeper were his reasons for retracting.

However, Kerik's past dealings may have been the strongest reason for his decision to withdraw from the nomination. Newsweek has uncovered that as recently as 1998, a New Jersey judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kerik following a tangled web of lawsuits relating to unpaid bills on a condominum. Newsday and the Seattle Times have reported that Kerik may have business ties to the Mob and allegations of two extramarital affairs have arisen.

In addition, his windfall profit from stock options in Taser International (i.e. ""Taser guns"") with no apparent investment, has been under heavy investigation.

Russian researchers warn that Western Siberia has begun to thaw as a result of global warming. The frozen peat bogs in this,"region are now melting, and the methane gas they contain is being released into the atmosphere.
The scientists say that the release of methane from these bogs could have a significant impact on climate change.
“We’ve been studying the permafrost for 10 years,” said Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “It’s not just about the Arctic. It’s also about the rest of the world.”
Romanovsky says that the permafrost in Russia’s West Siberian Plain contains more","region may hold billions of tons of methane gas, which may be released into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

Sergei Kirpotin, of Tomsk State University warned New Scientist that the event is an ""ecological landslide that is probably irreversible and is undoubtedly connected to climatic warming"".

David Viner, of the University of East Anglia told The Guardian: ""When you start messing around with these natural systems, you can end up in situations where it's unstoppable"". He also warns that this event was not considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

In May, scientists from the University of Alaska found methane ""hotspots"" in eastern Siberia where the gas bubbles out from thawing permafrost bogs at a rate that prevents the surface from freezing.

The permafrost has been intact for 11,000 years and started melting 3 to 4 years ago, according to Kirpotin.

The Court at Old Bailey in London found that Zardad pursued a reign of fear along his checkpoints and ordered summary executions and torture of innocent civilians. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.

Zardad denied all charges throughout the trials, and claimed he had been set up by enemies in Afghanistan.

""I have never killed anybody and if anybody in the whole of Afghanistan can produce that evidence against me then I will accept that crime,"" he said.

The case is considered to be a landmark in international law. British law allows the prosecution of crimes like torture and hostage-taking in the UK even if no British citizen was involved and the incidents occurred overseas. ""There are some crimes which are so heinous, such an affront to justice, that they can be tried in any country"", Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith said.

"An outbreak of cholera in West Africa has resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people, and United Nations (UN)","officials are warning that the disease could spread to other countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that the outbreak had been declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"" by the UN's executive board.
Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal illness caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It can kill within hours if untreated.
The WHO said the outbreak was centred in Guinea but had also affected Sierra Leone and Liberia.
It said","health officials are concerned that inadequate health services in the region could result in many more deaths.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that over 31,250 cases of cholera have been reported so far this year in nine West African countries. It has claimed 488 lives at this point. ""If we look at this year's trends, the figures are still going up in many countries,"" said John Mulangu, a senior regional advisor for the WHO. ""If cholera is not brought under control in certain regions, we will soon be talking of... 100,000 cases,"" he said. ""And hospitals and health centres will be overwhelmed. Last year we were not on this scale. The problem is getting worse,"" Mulangu said.

The UN says that the increase could also be related to the fact that due to poverty, many West Africans move around, sometimes out of the country, in order to receive higher wages for their work, and the region has been hit with heavy rains. This helps spread the disease, according to the UN.

""We are about to enter the harvest season where people will be moving around,"" said Herve Ludovic de Lys, the head of OCHA's West Africa office. ""The main goal is to halt the transmission of this disease,"" he said. ""It's not business as usual. This crisis needs a rapid response.""

The following West African nations have all been hit by cholera epidemics: Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Senegal. The WHO issued a statement on Thursday that more countries were at risk. ""Outbreaks are likely to spread to Central Africa - Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad - in the next weeks,"" it said."

""We have a duty to remove people who do not have a right to remain in the UK,"" a spokesman for the agency told AFP.
""These individuals have been refused asylum and we will be removing them from the country.""
The UKBA said that the group of 19 men and one woman had all been refused asylum and were","to Northern Iraq from the detention centres where they are currently being held beginning August 28.

Despite a warning by the UN High Commission for Refugees that no part of Iraq is now safe, the Home Office is reported to be sending the men back as soon as 28 August in an Iraqi military aeroplane. Paul Kessler of UNHCR has said that kidnappings and other security problems are still common in Northern Iraq.

Returns to Iraq had been voluntary, but according to The Times around 100 rejected asylum seekers have been arrested and are now in detention.

Demonstrations have been held across the country and are expected outside the Home Office today, 26 August.

"The inflation rate in Ireland, as measured by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), edged upwards to hit a five month high in May at","0.8%.

However, the CSO said that the annual rate of inflation remained below the European Union average of 1.9%, which is currently the lowest level since November 2009.
The CSO also reported that the cost of living increased by 0.3% in May when compared with the same period last year.
This means that the annual rate of inflation has now fallen from 1.6% in April","2.4%. This represents a 0.2% rise on the previous month when the rate stood at 2.2%.

The major contributors to the rise were increased transportation, healthcare, and education costs. In April the EU25 average rate of inflation was 2.1%, with Latvia having the highest rate at 7.1% and Sweden the lowest at 0.4%.

Despite the increase in the rate, Irish inflation remains very low - having hit 7% during 2000 and remaining around the 5% until the beginning of 2003. Another major factor easing any worries about the increase is Ireland's very strong GDP growth - expected to be around 5.5% this year

"On the first anniversary of Gmail's release, Google has announced that it will increase the amount of storage available for the users of the web-","based email service.
The company said in a blog post on Monday that it would be increasing the free storage space from 2GB to 4GB and also allow users to store up to 7GB of data in their accounts.
""We're happy to announce that we've increased the size of your free Gmail account to 4 GB,"" wrote Google product manager Todd Jackson. ""This means you can now keep more of your important messages right where you need them.""
Google had launched Gmail with 1GB of storage space last year. The company had then said that it was planning to offer","based email service from 1 GB to over 2 GB. Additionally, they have added formatting rich-text features to Gmail. According to a page at the Gmail Help Center, while not all accounts currently have the formatting features added, ""over the next several weeks, we are introducing rich formatting to all of our users.""

The increase in storage is announced on the main Gmail page with a JavaScript counter that increases the quoted available storage in relation to the current date. For example, on April 1 at 5 a.m. UTC the site announced 1025 MB available, 30 hours later &amp;mdash; 2050 MB, and a week later it should announce a total of 2075 MB.

Unless Google adjusts the code behind the counter, the text will read ""Over 2075"" after April 9.

Oregon State University (OSU) animal researchers in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Dubois,"Agricultural Research Center have developed a new method to study how animals respond to stress, which could lead to better ways to manage and treat stress-related diseases in livestock.
The research team has developed a technique that uses a small amount of radioactive carbon dioxide gas to measure how much oxygen is being used by an animal's body during times of stress. The technique can be used on any species of animal, including humans.
""This is a very exciting development,"" said Dr. John Hunt, director of OSU's College of Veterinary Medicine. ""It will allow us to",", Idaho-based Sheep Experiment Station released a report on an OSU-USDA study which was initiated in 1995 after breeders asked the government to determine why some rams bought as breeding studs showed no interest in females. The researchers are working under a $2.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in hopes of developing a test which can determine the likelihood of a ram being female-oriented before it is sold as a stud.

By studying difference in the animal's brains after slaughter, the study also showed what could be a biological determiner for what makes a ram male-oriented instead of female-oriented sexually. The scientists' results showed that the anterior preoptic area of the rams' hypothalamus was 50 percent smaller in male-oriented rams as opposed to female oriented rams. A 1991 study of human brains of AIDS victims showed a similar hypothalamus size difference between gay and heterosexual men.

The sheep researchers postulate that low levels of aromatase hormones in the brain of a developing male sheep fetus may have kept the brain from fully masculinizing, leading to sexually male-oriented rams.

""This lends further support to the idea that homosexuality has biological underpinnings,"" Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology, said in an interview with the Corvallis Gazette-Times.

Professor Stormshak believes that ""understanding sexual drives and the continuum of sexual behavior could possibly help explain the scientific basis of sexual assault and put an end to assertions that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."""
"Five schoolgirls, all between thirteen and sixteen, have died in a bus crash in County Meath, Ireland. The three vehicle crash","happened at around 10:30am local time on the M3 motorway near Ashbourne.
The girls were travelling to Dublin for a school trip when their bus collided with two other vehicles. One of the cars was a lorry carrying cattle.
The driver of the bus has been arrested by Gardaí (Irish police) and is being questioned about the incident.
A spokesman for the Irish Defence Forces said that they had sent an air ambulance to the scene but it was not needed as the injured were taken to hospital by road.
The five girls who died",", involving a school bus carrying fifty-one teenagers and two cars, occurred at 4.30pm on a straight section of the Navan to Kentstown road.

Apart from the five fatalities, six children in a critical state and nineteen others with less serious injuries have been admitted to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. Six more teenagers, also in a critical state, and twenty others with lesser injuries have been admitted to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, County Louth.

The bus was carrying secondary school students from four schools home when the accident occurred. At present it is unknown what caused the accident - but it is suspected that the two cars collided head on and the bus then attempted to swerve in order to avoid them, causing it to topple over. Several investigations have begun; including one by the Gardaí and one by Bus Eireann.

The accident was quickly responded to by an emergency plan which lead to fourteen ambulances, several fire engines, squad cars and a few helicopters arriving on the scene within minutes."
Apple Computer has formally acknowledged that the screens on some of its new iPod nano units are prone to scratching and cracking. The company,"said it is working with suppliers to improve the quality of the plastic used in the screen, but did not say when a fix would be available.
The problem was first reported by Macworld magazine, which said that the screens were easily scratched and could even break if dropped from a short distance.
Apple spokeswoman Natalie Harrison confirmed the problem, saying: ""We're aware of this issue and we're working closely with our supplier to resolve it.""
She declined to comment further.
The iPod nano is one of three new models introduced by Apple last month. It comes","has agreed to replace units with a cracked screen free of charge.

Several customers found that the screens of their brand new iPod nano MP3 players were cracking and scratching easily. According to Tyler Hall the creator of http://www.nanoscratch.com, his iPod nano was scratched within 30 minutes of use in the pocket of his shirt. He posted his concerns to the Apple support forums, but his post was deleted. He created www.nanoscratch.com to allow other users to post comments on the iPod’s “scratchability” and post photos of scratched iPods.

""This is a real but minor issue that involved a vendor quality problem in a small number of units,"" said Apple spokesperson Tom Neumayr. Apple estimates that these issues affected less then 0.01% of the total iPod Nanos shipped.

In most individual cases Apple has been telling customers that the scratches and cracks were covered under warranty. Standard warranties on most electronic products do not normally cover cosmetic damage such as scratches or accidental damage such as cracks. Users with a cracked screen can now contact Apple for a free replacement."

As of September 1, 2005, Black","water USA has been awarded a $27 million contract to provide security for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq. The company is also providing security for the U.S. Consulate in Basra, Iraq.
Blackwater USA is a private military company that provides armed guards and training services to governments and corporations worldwide. It was founded by Erik Prince, a former Navy SEAL who served as an officer in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.
The company's name comes from the Blackwater River in North Carolina, where it was founded.
In 2","water USA sent equipment and security forces to the Hurricane Katrina disaster area, including a SA-330J Puma helicopter, with the stated purpose of assisting in the evacuation of citizens from flooded areas. A later press release on Blackwater USA's web site confirms that their privately contracted forces are on the ground in New Orleans, being used to secure petrochemical facilities and provide security services for the federal government.

Private citizens are also reported to be hiring Blackwater ""military warriors"" and bodyguards to protect them and/or their expensive homes in New Orleans, such as in the Garden District, despite the repeated mandatory evacuation orders of all civilians by local, state, and federal authorities. One publication has reported that the number of soldiers for hire could be in the hundreds, as told to them by the commander of Blackwater's operations in the city. Israeli mercenaries from the firm known as ISI were also seen guarding a gated community, and were wearing full military gear including bulletproof vests and M16 assault rifles.

Blackwater has a history of being employed by the U.S. government and by private contractors across Iraq over the last two years to protect civilian and military convoys and provide security and bodyguarding services."

Two explosions were heard before 4am EST this morning, outside the 21-story building housing the British consulate in midtown Manhattan ( map). The NYPD's bomb squad was called to the scene, and checked the area for further explosive devices. CNN and the Times Online reported a blast at 3:35; an AP report mentioned two blasts around 3:50 from ""in or near a cement flower box,"" according to NYPD spokesman Noel Waters.

The damage from the explosion included broken windows in the building, a parked car, and the front door of the building. NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg noted that police closed Third Avenue between 51st and 53rd Streets. European markets reacted quickly to the news, which briefly increased volatility in all assets, according to Dow Jones news wires.

According to the British tabloid newspaper ""The Daily Mirror"", Omar allegedly shouted at police to ""Get back or I'll take you with me"".

After a struggle ensued involving, it is believed, a rucksack that police feared was a bomb, Omar was shot in the bathroom by a 50,000-volt taser stun gun that temporarily disabled him. The rucksack was apparently thrown outside the window by police officers.

Around 100 homes were subsequently evacuated as a precautionary measure on the orders of the RLC bomb disposal team. The team then made a controlled explosion of the suspect package.

In a house in nearby Bankdale Road, three men, thought to be Somalis, were arrested and taken to a local police station.

Omar was later taken to Paddington Green, West London, the Metropolitan Police's only high-security police station.

The flat in Birmingham remained guarded by police while forensic tests continued.

"The Peace Tax Seven, who are campaigning to have the 10 per cent of their taxes which go to Britain's defence budget divert","ed into peaceful projects, will be in court on Monday.
The seven - five Quakers and two Anglicans - were arrested last year for refusing to pay income tax because they believe it is wrong to use money to kill people. They are being prosecuted by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) under Section 83 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
The case has been brought against them by HMRC after a previous attempt to prosecute failed when the Crown Prosecution Service decided that there was no public interest in pursuing the","ed to non-military uses, have had their case rejected by a High Court judge.

The judicial review was called for under article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees freedom 'to manifest one's religion or beliefs' and which was made a part of British law in 1998. The Convention includes the right to conscientious objection and the campaigners claim that this gives them the right not to pay other people to go to war on their behalf.

Their statement to the court said: ""We want to make a positive contribution to society by paying our tax in full. We object in conscience to paying others to kill on our behalf, but current tax policy forces us to do just that.""

The courtroom had to be enlarged to make room for supporters and the judge listened to the case for three hours.

Roy Prockter, an accountant and campaign member as well as a Quaker, said that the judge told them that ""our case has no possibility of being resolved in the British courts"". According to the Guardian, the judge suggested they take the case to Strasbourg. Roy said that the members were going to take time for reflection as they awaited the written judgment from the judge."

At about 5pm EDT Tuesday one of Discovery's cockpit window covers became detached and fell sixty feet. The falling cover struck the left Orbital Maneuvering System pod (situated to one side of the tail fin), damaging several thermal protection tiles. The tiles provide vital protection to the Orbiter as it makes its fiery re-entry to Earth's atmosphere.

A replacement panel was fitted in less than an hour, with the only effect being a delay in rolling back the pad's Rotating Service Structure.

This has been the only issue in the build up to today's launch, the first Shuttle flight since the Columbia Orbiter broke up during re-entry in February 2003. All crew were lost in that incident, which has been blamed on damage to a wing thermal protection system panel, caused by a block of fuel tank insulation that became detached and hit the Orbiter during the first moments of flight.

Discovery is due to take off at 3.51pm EDT today. The chance of a weather-related delay to the launch has increased to 40% - due to the possibility of thunderstorms in the area."

"explanation=This article refers to the ""US Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)"", though the term ""Department of Environmental Protection",""" is used in the article.
The United States Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is a federal agency that was created by the 1970 Clean Air Act and the 1972 Clean Water Act, which were passed by Congress as part of President Richard Nixon's environmental program. The DEP has been criticized for its lack of enforcement of environmental laws, and for being too cozy with industry.
In 1985, the EPA was given authority over the Superfund program, which deals with cleaning up hazardous waste sites",""" actually refers to state agencies, and in this case refers to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, not a United States federal agency.

The Cambridge city council adopted a resolution on April 4 to request that the US Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) ""take explicit account"" of the activities of local construction firm W. R. Grace, which has previously contaminated an industrial area near the Alewife train station with asbestos. The council cited Grace's ""extraordinarily extensive and well-documented history of contaminating sites and concealing the contamination"" as the reason for its request.

The resolution was a reaction to a Response Action Outcome Statement and Risk Characterization (RAO) that W. R. Grace filed with the DEP. The Cambridge Chronicle recently took the filing as evidence that ""the state seems poised to stop watching over"" the contaminated site.

In February, W.R. Grace was indicted by a federal grand jury for contamination as a product of vermiculite mining operations in Libby, Montana, USA. The company was also charged with ""concealing information about the health affects sic of its asbestos mining operations."""
An elementary school in northern California has been testing a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag-based identification program on its 7th and 8,"th grade students. The system, which is being used to track the location of students during the school day, was installed by the company Zebra Technologies.
The RFID tags are attached to the student's clothing and can be read from up to 30 feet away. The system uses an antenna that transmits a signal to the tag, which then sends back a unique ID number. The data is stored in a database and can be accessed through a computer or mobile device.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the school district has not yet decided whether it will continue using the system after","th grade students since January 18th, 2005. According to the ACLU, this is the first time that public school students in the United States have been required to wear devices that enable automatic identification. RFIDs have previously been used to track students in Japan.

RFID tags contain antennas to enable them to receive and respond to radio-frequency queries from an RFID transceiver, enabling identification of pupils when they are in the vicinity of the detectors.

Each student is required to wear an ID card on a lanyard around their neck. An RFID tag, manufactured by local Sutter corporation Incom, is attached to the card. The school has installed RFID detectors at the doors of seven classrooms as well as the bathrooms, though they claim that the bathroom units were not turned on, and subsequently been removed after complaints from parents.

While some parents have complained about the system, local high school teacher Tim Crabtree told the San Francisco Chronicle, ""It's baffling why so many people are bothered by the district being able to tell them where their kids are at,""

On the other side, the San Francisco Chronicle quotes the 13-year-old daughter of Michelle and Jeff Tatro as saying:""Look at this. I'm a grocery item. I'm a piece of meat. I'm an orange.""

The first findings from the preliminary investigations into Sunday's air disaster have been released. All 121 on board a Hel,"ios Airways flight from Cyprus to Athens died when the plane crashed in Greece.
The Greek government has ordered an investigation into the cause of the crash, which occurred shortly after take-off from Larnaca Airport.
A statement issued by the Civil Aviation Authority said that the aircraft had taken off at 0935 local time (0635 GMT) and was flying at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,440 metres).
It then began to descend rapidly and crashed into a mountain near the village of Grammatiko, about","ios Boeing 737 died when it crashed near Athens after flying from Cyprus. A text message, reportedly sent from the doomed aircraft, has also been revealed as a hoax.

Greek Chief Coroner Philippos Koutsaftis stated ""Until now I have done an autopsy on six bodies and first evidence is that when they were killed they had circulation in their heart and lungs.

""That does not mean that they were conscious but that they had breath and circulation. They had circulation and heartbeat so they were alive.""

Initial reports from the Greek Defence Ministry had suggested the bodies were ""frozen solid"" at the moment of impact.

The coroner stressed that as more post mortems were carried out new evidence may come to light.

Nothing is known about the cause of the disaster beyond the fact that everyone on board the airliner was incapacitated at some point, and that emergency oxygen masks had been used. Speculation abounds, with the theory that the airliner failed to maintain pressurisation at some point being the most popular theory.

Helios has said the aircraft was maintained in line with European regulations and had also received a standard inspection before take-off.

Greek police have also arrested a man who claimed his cousin texted him from the airliner, saying the pilots were blue in the face and that they were freezing. He was brought to the district attorney where two charges were filed against him, for lying to the authorities and for spreading false information, and a trial was scheduled. The man claimed that his intention was to gain publicity.

Police have also attended Helios's offices to requisition documents as part of the investigation into the disaster.

"The growing power of the Internet is clearly reflected in the decision, announced Tuesday, for the Associated Press to begin charging newspapers and broad","casters for access to its news stories.
The AP has been a free service since 1948, when it was founded by 23 news organizations that wanted to share their reporting with each other. But now, as more people get their news online, the AP says it needs to charge for its services.
""We're not going to be able to continue to provide this service at no cost,"" said Tom Curley, president and CEO of the AP. ""It's just not sustainable.""
Curley said the AP will offer two tiers of service: one for small-","casters to post wire stories, photos, and other content on their online editions. The changes go into effect January 1, 2006. An advisory committee meeting will be held in the fall to ease the transition.

As the Internet draws more news consumers from traditional repositories of data, increasing numbers are demanding the stories on the Internet reflect the quick updating and coverage of a large wire network such as the Associated Press.

The rates the AP charges, known within as “assessments”, have risen by about 2.75 percent annually during the 90’s. Since the service is supposed to be not-for-profit and is owned by its customers, price increases are a tough sell.

The formula for the new calculations still has not been set, making it difficult to determine how the changes will affect what the outlets charge for their online news coverage. Currently the AP bases rates on newspaper circulation or broadcast audience with the large ones footing the major part of the bill.

The AP is creating a computer database of news paraphernalia which includes stories, photos, graphics, audio and video. It is all designed to make it easier for news rooms to create usable content."

The inquiry will be headed by former High Court judge Michael Kirby and will look at the circumstances surrounding the arrest, detention and deportation of Cornelia Rau from Australia to Japan.
Ms Rau was arrested on April 29 after she told police that her son had been abducted. She was later found to have no legal right to remain in Australia.
She was held in a Tokyo immigration centre for 10 days before being deported back to Australia.
Mr Howard said he wanted to ensure that such a situation would never happen again","months and allegedly maltreated by the country's own Immigration Department.

The woman, Cornelia Rau, still insisted she was German Anna Schmidt, according to her sister Christine yesterday. ""I think it will take a long time for her to stabilise,"" she said. ""At the moment she doesn't accept that she is Cornelia and she doesn't want to see us.""

""She is still insisting her name is Anna Schmidt and that her passport is in Baxter and that she wants to return to Germany.""

Refugee advocate Pamela Curr claims Ms Rau was held in isolation for 18 to 20 hours a day in Baxter's 'Red One' isolation facility, where she was allegedly kept in simulated daylight for 24 hours a day.

Her family had only discovered her whereabouts through a refugee-initiated effort to identify the woman, authorities having failed to connect the unidentified detainee with her missing person file, held by New South Wales Police since August last year.

After her family recognised media reports of her on Thursday, and contacted the police, her photo was emailed to the Baxter compound and her identity confirmed.

The schizophrenic woman had spent six months in a Queensland prison, according to Channel Nine News, as well as at least two months in immigration detention, according to various sources. Earlier reports had her being handed over to immigration authorities over 10 months ago, with only five days spent in custody with Queensland Police.

Ms Rau is presently recuperating in hospital."

In 1983 she was elected to the House of Commons as MP for Redcar, a seat she held until","in a hospice after a fall two weeks ago. She was 55.

In a statement, prime minister Tony Blair called her ""one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered. She was a natural politician, could read a situation and analyse and assess it as fast as anyone.""

Another former cabinet minister, Clare Short, said: ""She was a very beautiful young woman, she survived ill health and helped bring peace to Northern Ireland and now she's gone far too young.""

Mo Mowlam was central to the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and was popular in Britain for her straightforward approach, informality and honesty.

Ms Mowlam even received a standing ovation during prime minister Blair's speech during the 1998 Labour Party Conference.

Mo Mowlam retired from political life in 2001, but continued to make the headlines by realising her autobiography which was critical of Blair's presidential style of government.

It is thought that the fall that made her go to hospital, and then the hospice where she died, was due to a lack of balance caused by a brain tumour."

According to Hall, early ultrasound images indicated Bai Yun was pregnant with twins. However, zoo personnel became suspicious that one fetus was no longer viable after veterinarians failed to detect a heartbeat in one cub last week. Bai Yun failed to give birth to a second cub Tuesday evening. ""It is likely that the second fetus died in utero and was reabsorbed by her body,"" Hall said.

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palesinian President Mahmoud Abbas today declared an end to military and violent activities against each other,".
The two leaders signed a document in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, which also calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state by 2005.
""We have decided to put an end to all acts of violence between us,"" Mr Sharon said at a joint news conference with Mr Abbas. ""We will not allow terrorism to continue.""
Mr Abbas said: ""I declare that we are ending the armed intifada (uprising) and we are declaring an end to all forms of violence.""
He added: ""We are declaring an end to all",". The two leaders made the expected announcement at a summit held at Shram el-Sheikh, Egypt, the first such meeting between the two sides in four years.

Prime Minister Sharon pledged to end military operations against Palestinians, and President Abbas similarly said that the Palestinians will likewise end ""all acts of violence against Israelis....wherever they are"". Both leaders expressed hope that the agreement will lead to long term peace in the long-running conflict. Prime Minister Sharon said that the agreement is part of the goal of ""quiet, dignified and peaceful lives for all the nations in the Middle East"". President Abbas said ""the calm that is currently prevailing in our territories signals the start of a new era, the start of a hopeful peace."" Both sides also confirmed their intent to create an independent Palestinian state. The talks became possible in the renewed optimism after the death of Yassir Arafat and the election of Abbas.

The agreement marks a profound change in Israeli-Palestinian relations, but the negotiated truce is a shaky peace. The ability of President Abbas to exert control over Palestinian militant groups is questionable, and thorny political issues remain for the Israelis if they begin to withdraw settlers from the occupied territories. There are signs that the Palestinian resistance groups are willing to participate in the cease-fire: the terrorist organisation, HAMAS released a statement in the hours before the summic stating that ""was prepared to calm down resistance raids in the event the Zionist entity reciprocated,"" referring to Sharon's pledge to stop military activities, yet shortly after the summit a spokesman for the organization said it will not be bound by the cease-fire.

The ICE is currently lobbying the government to make VoIP illegal.","a criminal offence. In Costa Rica it has been illegal for anyone other than ICE to offer telephone services. With a reputation for preventing any rivals from challenging its monopoly, but also for providing an efficient service, ICE has recently seen its monopoly dented with as many as 20% of calls being routed through Skype and other VoIP service providers.

On the other hand those who seek to promote the software industry in Costa Rica, which already has a dominant 78% share of the market in Central America and the Caribbean, have reacted by saying the proposal would be disastrous both to software development and the country's ability to outsource work. The ICE claims that its telephone structure is being used by VoIP service providers, which is almost certainly true given that Skype offers calls from the Internet to phones in Costa Rica for 8 US$ cents per minute."
"Irish low fares airline Ryanair has announced it is to commence service of two new routes from Shannon Airport in County Clare, Ireland. It","will operate a twice weekly service between Shannon and London Stansted Airport in the UK starting on 29th March 2013. The second route will be a thrice weekly service between Shannon and Brussels Charleroi Airport in Belgium starting on 26th March 2013.
The announcement was made by Michael O’Leary, Chief Executive Officer of Ryanair at a press conference held at Shannon Airport today (Tuesday).
“We are delighted that Ryanair has chosen to expand its services from Shannon with these two new routes,” said","will now fly to Bristol, England daily and to Nantes, France three times a week. The airline will also increase the frequency of its Shannon-Frankfurt route.

Shannon airport has seen its traffic figures soar in the past year since Ryanair established a new base there. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has said he expects the new routes to bring an additional 200,000 passengers to the airport.

Despite the positive announcement of the new routes on Thursday, Ryanair's share price plunged by 10% on the same day due to the London bombings that morning. However the share price recovered substantially on Friday.

Ryanair is the world's most profitable airline, having reported record profits of €269m earlier this year, and is pursuing an aggressive expansion plan which will see it's total number of passengers jump to 70m over the next few years. At present Ryanair has 91 aircraft and 230 Boeing 737's on order."
The BBC reported on January 27 that statistics released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health showed that Coalition forces killed 60% of the,"civilian population in Fallujah.
The report was based on a study conducted by the ministry, which said that 1,349 civilians were killed and 5,800 wounded during the assault on the city.
The BBC also quoted an unnamed US military spokesman as saying that ""the coalition is aware of the allegations"" but that it had not seen any evidence to support them.
The BBC's correspondent in Baghdad, Caroline Hawley, says that the figures are likely to be disputed by both sides.
She says that the US military has","civilians that died in the period July 2004 to January 2005.

The figures, normally available only to the Iraqi cabinet, show a total of 3,274 Iraqi civilians were killed and 12,657 wounded during the continuing conflict. These figures exclude the deaths of known insurgents.

However according to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, the BBC misunderstood the matter. According to the previous story from BBC these figures were a result of Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces military operations.

However, the Iraqi Ministry of Health explained that the published figures also include Iraqis killed by terrorists, not only those killed by Coalition forces or Iraqi security forces; and that those recorded as killed in military action included terrorists themselves, and Iraqi security forces.

The BBC recognized their error and apologized in a recent news item, and retracted the conclusions drawn by their original report:

""The BBC regrets mistakes in its published and broadcast reports yesterday,"" reported the BBC.""

The figures, based on records from Iraqi public hospitals released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health, are shown in the following table:

Shortly before the release of the figures by the BBC, US Ambassador John Negroponte had told BBC reporter John Simpson:

""My impression is that the largest amount of civilian casualties definitely is a result of these indiscriminate car bombings."""
In an address to the ongoing conference of Asian and African nations Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi offered apologies for the suffering caused by Japanese,"troops during World War II.
The prime minister said that Japan was ""deeply remorseful"" about its past actions, but he did not offer any specific apology for the use of forced labor or sexual slavery by Japanese soldiers in Asia.
Mr. Koizumi's speech came as a surprise to many observers because it was not included in his prepared remarks. He spoke after South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun called on Japan to apologize for its colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945.
In his speech Mr. Koizumi said Japan","aggression in the 1930s and 40s.

""In the past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility,"" after this Koizumi added that the Japanese people have ""feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology.""

Koizumi's apology was the first apology offered by a Japanese leader for its country's past in the presence of such a large number of government leaders from different countries."
"Commander Leroy Chiao (U.S.A.) and Flight Engineer Salizhan Sharipov (Russia), suited","up for a spacewalk outside the International Space Station on March 10, 2005.
The first spacewalk of Expedition 9 was performed by Russian cosmonaut Salizhan Sharipov and American astronaut Leroy Chiao on March 10, 2005. The two men spent six hours and 43 minutes outside the station, installing a new ammonia tank assembly and replacing an old one. They also installed a new antenna and removed a failed camera from the Zvezda service module.
The spacewalk began at 1:06","in Russian Orlan spacesuits, left the International Space Station on a 4.5 hour long spacewalk to install antennas for the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), inspect and photograph other exterior equipment and launched the Nanosatellite mini-satellite. This is the last scheduled walk for the Expedition 10 crew.

At 06:25 UTC, the two astronauts left the station from the Pirs DC1 docking compartment/airlock and proceeded to install the last three of six space-to-space communication antennas for the ATV's rendezvous and docking with the ISS next year.

Sharipov next deployed the foot long, 11 pound Russian Nanosatellite, tossing it into space by hand. The object of the experiment is to develop small satellite control techniques, monitor satellite
operations and develop new attitude system sensors. Russian ground crews reported good signal reception from the satellite two hours after its release.

The two astronauts next proceeded to the aft end of the Zvezda service module. A Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna and necessary cabling for the ATV was installed and the men worked their way back to the airlock.

The station maintained its attitude, despite the loss of a gyroscope earlier in the space station mission, until the end of the spacewalk. Chiao and Sharipov reported being a safe distance from the attitude adjustment thrusters. Russian ground control activated the jets and normal attitude of
the station was regained.

They returned to the airlock at 1055 UTC, completing the mission an hour earlier than scheduled.

Chiao and Sharipov arrived on the station October 16, 2004. They are scheduled to return to Earth on April 25, 2005. This marks Sharipov's second walk in space and Chiao's sixth."
"Pope John Paul II has been taken to hospital and is suffering from a ""breathing crisis"", the Vatican has confirmed.

The V","atican said in a statement that the 84-year-old pontiff was being treated for an acute respiratory infection at Gemelli Hospital in Rome.

""His Holiness' condition is serious but stable,"" it added.

Pope John Paul II, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, had been due to celebrate Mass on Sunday in St Peter's Square.

He was admitted to hospital on Saturday after feeling unwell during his weekly general audience.

A spokesman for the Holy See said he was expected to be discharged later on","atican said in a statement that the Pope, 84, is suffering from an acute respiratory infection. He was admitted to the Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital at 2300 local time (2200 UTC).

According to the Vatican the Pontiff is suffering from an acute inflammation of the larynx as well as laryngo-spasms that constrict the lung's intake of air. He was diagnosed with a severe flu three days ago and taken to Gamelli as a precaution.

The Pope is no stranger to Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital. In 1981 he was taken there after being shot in the abdomen by Mehmet Ali Agca and he has been re-admitted at least three times since.

Although the Vatican usually does not comment on the pontiff's state of health, it is widely known that the Pope suffers from Parkinson's disease, and chronic joint problems."
The New Zealand Labour Party announced its party list admidst speculations it may call an early election. The election must be held before Sept 24,", 2017.
The National Party is the current governing party and has been in power since 2008. It is led by Prime Minister Bill English.
The Labour Party is the main opposition party. It is led by Jacinda Ardern.
The Green Party is a minority partner in the coalition government. It is led by Metiria Turei.
The Maori Party is also a minority partner in the coalition government. It is led by Marama Fox.
The Māori Party was formed in 2004 to represent the interests of M","2005. The list ranking is often seen as a ranking of the importance for each politician to the party.

Hon. Parekura Horomia was ranked at number five, the highest ranking of any Maori MP. The Maori MPs face a strong challenge from the newly formed Maori Party. Shane Jones, the highest placed non-MP, is all but assured of a seat in the next Parliament. Steven Ching is placed at 42, and represents Labour's interest in courting the Asian vote. The Asian population has grown significantly over the past ten years within New Zealand.

The surprising absentee is Hon. George Hawkins, the Minister of Police. He has been criticised for performing poorly in the House, and it is speculated he was offered a low ranking and refused. He is likely to return to Parliament on the basis of his strong hold on the Manurewa electorate seat.

At the time, no other major political party has released its list.

New Zealand changed its electoral system to MMP in 1996, before then it used FPP. In the 2002 election, Labour won 52 seats. Labour then became government in a minority coalition. Elections are held every three years in New Zealand."
Volunteers began a 60 day bed-rest marathon on March 19 to study simulated weightlessness effects on women astronaut,"s. The experiment is being conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas.
The volunteers are confined to their beds for 24 hours a day and are not allowed to get up until they have completed the 60 days. They will be monitored by doctors and nurses who will record any changes in their health.
The experiment is designed to simulate the conditions that female astronauts would experience during space flight. It is hoped that the results will help scientists understand how long term exposure to microgravity affects the human body.
The experiment is part of","s. The study, Women International Space Simulation for Exploration(WISE), is conducted at the MEDES Space Clinic in Toulouse, France.

The 12 women, selected from 1600 applicants hailing from France,Great Britain, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic began the study after a 20 day screening for baseline comparison data as the study progressed.

The women will conduct all activities from eating, bathing, and reading while lying in hospital beds tilted headfirst at a six degree angle. This particular position, called head-down tilt bed rest was determined from previous studies to remove the vertical load of gravity on the body, inducing changes similar to what astronauts in a genuine weightless environment experience .

Long term exposure to weightlessness creates a number of physiological and psychological problems in astronauts such as:
*Reduced capacity for physical exertion
*Muscle atrophy
*Affects of confinement and isolation
*Impaired circulatory function

A total of 24 women will participate in the study. A second group of 12 will join in September.

Three groups of eight women each will be studied over the course of the two campaigns of bed rest. One group will serve as a control, receiving no specific treatments, the second will exercise, while the third will receive nutritional supplements.

The study is designed to fill in gaps of knowledge on the differences between men and women during extended weightlessness. It also aims to develop countermeasures for reducing the debilitating effects of long spaceflights.

Participating agencies in the study include the European Space Agency, NASA, the French Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency."

"Vladimir Putin has relieved from power Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the head of the Russian navy. This comes a month after an incident","in which two Russian warships collided with each other and sank.
The Kremlin said on Monday that President Vladimir Putin had signed a decree to appoint Vice-Admiral Viktor Chirkov as the new commander-in-chief of Russia's navy.
Chirkov is currently the deputy chief of staff of the Russian armed forces. He will take over his new post on August 15.
Kuroyedov was appointed to the position in December 2007. His tenure was marked by several incidents involving Russian naval vessels. In May, two","where 7 Russian sailors became trapped in a submarine, and had to be rescued with help from abroad.

No reason was given for Kuroyedov's dismissal, although Admiral Eduard Baltin speculated on Moscow Radio that it may be because of the navy chief's poor health. According to Reuters, he told Ekho Moskvy: ""He has been lying in hospital for two months, he had a complicated operation.""

Admiral Kuroyedov was in charge of the navy during the Kursk disaster of 2000, in which 118 sailors died when their submarine sank. Kuroyedov is being replaced by Vladimir Masorin, who was previously serving as the Chief of staff for the Russian Navy.

In remarks Putin made about this leadership change and referring to Masorin, he said ""The recent exercises, including those I have attended, show that the navy is developing and that is certainly your merit to a large extent."" Putin also added ""at the same time, there were difficult events, tragedies, but I would like to underline once again that with all these problems, all these tragedies, the main thing is that the Navy is undergoing a revival.""

Masorin added while in a hall at the Admiralty, ""One thing is clear — to continue in the condition which we are in and do nothing is simply not possible. I have been given the task of stopping the navy shaking public opinion. I am not experiencing euphoria at being appointed head of the navy. I understand the level of responsibility on my shoulders."""
"The European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty on April 13
The President of Romania, Traian Băs","escu, has announced that the European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty on April 13.
""I have just received a letter from the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, in which he informs me that the European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty on April 13,"" said the President of Romania, Traian Băsescu, at the end of his meeting with the Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, who is paying an official visit to Bucharest.
According to the","escu, met yesterday with Jonathan Scheele, the head of the European Commission's Delegation to Bucharest, as well as with several European parliamentarians (MEPs). The parties discussed Romania's accession to the EU, which is particularly important as the Accession Treaty is scheduled to be signed late this month, after being voted on by the European Parliament on April 13.

Băsescu told the delegation that European integration remains Romania's first priority at the moment, and that after negotiations were closed with the EU in December 2004, accession became a matter of internal politics rather than foreign affairs.

The MEPs talked to Băsescu about public opinion regarding EU accession in Romania, as well as the impact of accession on the rural population. Judging from recent polls, the overwhelming majority of Romania's population approve EU accession, even though this may be partly due to the fact that many of them have not been adequately informed of the costs of accession. The parliamentarians also discussed the environment and the situation in neighbouring countries, especially Moldova. Tourism was also discussed in the context of promoting Romania's image to European Union citizens.

The delegation also discussed with Băsescu a key issue in Romania's accession process: judicial reform. The Romanian President told the MEPs that Romania has taken bold steps to reform its judiciary and fight corruption. There is also progress towards forming an anti-corruption department within the Internal Ministry of Romania.

As part of Romania's foreign policy, Băsescu also said that, once a member of the European Union, Romania would act as an advocate for other Southeastern European states wishing to join the organisation, as well as seeking to attract public attention to the broader Black Sea region. Romania and Bulgariaare the most advanced countries in Southeastern Europe in terms of EU integration, and will therefore be the first countries in this region to join the 25-nation bloc."
The Romanian Government has made plans and identified its aims for the next privatisation program which will end in 2006. By the,"end of this year, the government expects to sell off 15% of the shares of the state-owned oil company Petrom SA, while it is also planning to sell off 30% of the shares of the national railway company CFR SA.
The government has already sold off 49% of the shares of the state-owned electricity producer Electrica SA, and it is now considering selling off another 15%. It is also planning to sell off 100% of the shares of the state-owned telecommunications company Romtelecom SA.
In addition, the government is","end of next year, the government hopes to sell all of its shares in Romtelecom, Romania's largest telecommunications company, which is currently owned by Greece's OTE but which the government maintains a 47% share in. The full privatisation will occur in two phases, with some of the government's existing shares being sold on the Bucharest Stock Exchange this year, and the remainder being sold in 2006.

By 2006, the government also wants to sell its share in Postelecom, another telecommunications operator, and complete the privatisation of the Radiocomunicaţii, the national radio communications company.

The Government also wantes to begin analysis and consulting into the privatisation of Poşta Română, or Romanian Post, the full privatisation of which is set to be completed by 2009 at the latest.

Romania has embarked on a quite comprehensive program of privatisation since 2000, having privatised a part of Romtelecom, as well as full privatisations of several energy distributors and the nation's largest banks, in addition to other smaller companies. However, these privatisations are dwarfed by that of Petrom, Romania's national oil company, which was bought by Austria's OMV in 2004 and is the largest Romanian privatisation ever.

The current Liberal-Democrat governing coalition in Romania has privatisation and economic liberalism as one of its main policies, having also introduced a 16% flat tax rate for personal income and corporate profits at the start of 2005."

The union representing 1500 technical workers at UC Berkeley has been without a contract since July 2016. The union says that the university is trying to cut benefits and wages for its employees.
UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said in an email statement that the university is committed to reaching a fair agreement with the union.

The Coalition of University Employees accuses top UC officials of ignoring the union's requests regarding the high turnover rate of researchers. CUE organizers say the university is misleading the union about the quantity of money readily available for employee salary increases.

The UC officials deny accusations that they have bargained in bad faith, saying they have offered a contract to the researchers that's similar to an approved deal.

The National Union of Journalists (SNJ) said it had received information that the journalist, Ionut Ciobanu, was being held by an armed group in the city of Mosul.
Ciobanu is a reporter for the local TV station Al-Sharqiyah and also works as a correspondent for the Romanian daily Ziua. He was kidnapped while covering a demonstration against the presence of US troops in Iraq.
""We are asking the Iraqi ambassador","release of the three Romanian journalists kidnapped in Iraq in late March. The journalists wrote to the ambassador saying, ""We are convinced that the authorities in your country Iraq are doing everything possible to resolve the situation. Yet we are obliged to transmit our desire and hopes that efforts will be intensified.""

The fate of the journalists in the past few days has been quite underreported in the Romanian media, as the deadline for their killing has passed yet President Traian Băsescu said this Monday that he knows ""for certain"" the three are alive. The terrorists which kidnapped them aired a tape on Al-Jazeera, on April 23, that they would kill the journalists by April 27 if Romania does not withdraw its 860 troops from Iraq. Romania declined to withdraw the troops, and it seems the terrorists did not enforce their deadline.

Israel's Knesset has voted to approve the compensation package for Israeli settlers who will be impacted by the proposed disengagement,"plan.
The bill, which was passed with 60 votes in favour and 41 against, sets aside $25 million for the relocation of settlers from Gaza and four West Bank settlements.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he would not sign the bill into law until it had been approved by a committee of experts.
""I am not going to sign this bill until I have received the report of the committee,"" Mr Sharon told parliament.
""We are talking about a very sensitive issue.""
Mr Sharon is expected to present his final proposal on the diseng","from the Gaza Strip. Eight thousand Israelis will be evacuated from the Gaza Strip and four settlements in the northern West Bank removed.

MKs voted 59&amp;ndash;40 to approve a series of measures that will compensate the settlers who face relocation under the plan, with five abstentions from Arab MKs. Prime Minister Sharon's Likud party was split, with 18 MKs voting for it and 17 against.

The $1bn plan will now go before Sharon's cabinet on Sunday, where it is expected to be passed. After that, the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip could begin this summer.

However Sharon's government faces collapse if his budget is not passed by the Knesset by the end of March. If that deadline is not met, elections will be called and the plan may well be stopped.

Samsung announced it will market DVD players capable of playing back both Sony's Blu-Ray and Toshiba's HD DVD next,"year.
The company said the new players would be available in Japan, Europe and North America from early 2007.
Samsung is one of a number of companies that have been working on technology to play both formats.
It has also developed a hybrid player that can play both formats.
""We are pleased to announce our plans for the launch of dual format players,"" said Jaehoon Chung, president of Samsung Electronics' digital media division.
""This move demonstrates our commitment to providing consumers with choice and flexibility.""
Blu-ray and HD DVD are","-generation optical storage formats, if the two camps refuse to compromise on a single format. Assuming development is successful, consumers could expect to see such a device on store shelves next year.

Blu-Ray and HD DVD are projected to be the successor formats for current DVDs. Samsung, while leaning towards the Blu-Ray camp, hopes it can cover both bases by distributing a player with dual-compatibility. While this means spending more in development to unify the two technologies and develop a cost-effective production method, dual compatibility may pay off for the company if the formats challenge each other as VHS and Betamax did twenty-five years ago. Despite the support for Blu-Ray, Samsung has also been supportive of a unified standard to avoid such costly competition.

HD DVD offers single layer capacity of 15GB, more than triple the size of standard single layer DVDs, and benefits from similarities with current DVDs, such as cheap production and compatibility with current DVD players. Blu-Ray can hold 23GB on its smallest single layer version, and is reported to have superior durability and interactivity over current DVD-based technology and HD-DVD. HD-DVD is currently promoted by Toshiba, NEC, Sanyo and Microsoft; while Blu-Ray's base of support is the Blu-Ray Disc Association, which is led by Blu-Ray developers Sony and Philips. It is notable that Sony and Philips, who developed the Blu-Ray format, also competed against the Toshiba-designed SuperDisc DVD standard, which is the standard that is followed today.

The first Blu-Ray and HD DVD products are expected to start appearing in mainstream markets within the next year."

Another Dinamo transfer target is the Greek footballer Seitaridis, also playing for Porto, but this deal has not yet been confirmed.

Amkar (one of the poorest teams in Premier League) on the other hand, won the second match in a row. Despite conceding an early goal, Amkar was able to fight back, score from a penalty and secure a slender lead to win the away game.

Despite numerous signings between seasons and hiring a new coach, Oleg Romantsev, Dinamo's performance is far from the best. Last season saw them at 14th place (out of 16), barely avoiding relegation, and the start of a new season isn't promising either.

Today however, the airline now flies to over 200 European destinations with its fleet of 84 Boeing 737's and is awaiting the arrival of a future 225 aircraft from Boeing.

The company today carries as much as 3m passengers a month (depending on the season) and has revealed it made a profit of €245m (USD$307,916,000) in the past year. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated that the airline will carry over 70m passengers annually within five years. The notoriously eccentric Mullingar man went on to tell the press ""The very fact that a Mickey Mouse Irish airline can start in a field in Waterford 20 years ago and in 20 years overtake the world's self-styled, self proclaimed favourite airline is testament to the almost unstoppable demand for low airfare travel around Europe.""

To demonstrate the huge drop in airfares over the last year, the company claimed while the price of a Ryanair seat had dropped from £99.99 in 1985 to 99p today, the price of a pint of beer had trebled and the average house price in England had increased by 500%."
"Venezuela recognized that the mother of Ugueth Urbina, Maura Josefina Villareal, was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces","of Colombia (FARC) and is being held in a clandestine prison.
The Venezuelan government has been working with Colombian authorities to locate her.
Villareal was abducted on March 15th while traveling from Bogota to Cucuta, Colombia. She was traveling with her husband, Ugueth Urbina, who was also kidnapped but released after paying a ransom.
Urbina, a former major league pitcher for the Houston Astros, Washington Nationals, New York Mets, and Toronto Blue Jays, was fre","of Colombia (FARC-EP) commander Alvis Patiño, known as El Chiguiro. Urbina is a Venezuelan and a Major League Baseball right-handed closer who plays for the Detroit Tigers.

Chiguiro has been captured on February 2005. A delegation of authorities from Colombia was sent to Venezuela, so he could be identified. Now, after his identification, Colombian officers expects he can be extradicted to Colombia. In Colombia, Chiguiro is expected to be judged for the alleged crimes of kidnapping and murderer of the American missionaries Sthephen Everet and Thimoty Dike in 1995.

Some Venezuelan baseball players from the Major Leagues said that kidnapping is a new situation they must learn to live with. None of them said that the risk of kidnappings would prevent their return to Venezuela.

For years, Venezuelan cattlemen near Colombian borders say that they are victims of extorsion by FARC forces. This is the first time that the Venezuelan government recognizes that the FARC is responsible by this kind of crime in Venezuela.

According to the Colombian authorities, Chiguiro is envolved with the exchange of drugs by weapons with Brazilian traffic drug dealers."

In a scene repeated across much of America, each morning a group of day laborers, mostly immigrants, assemble by a 7-Eleven convenience store in the hopes of getting work.

Each day, nearly 200 people gather near the nation's capital in Herndon, Virginia; these laborers do much of the hard and dangerous work not wanted by most U.S. citizens. This daily gathering has drawn both the ire and compassion of the Herndon community. A public hearing Monday night to discuss a new plan drew an overflowing crowd to the Town Council chambers. The Commission said so many people signed up to speak at the hearing that the panel will need to convene again Tuesday night.

For years groups and businesses among the community who want to help the day laborers have been working on the issue. In a plan spearheaded by Bill Threlkeld, of the group Project Hope and Harmony, they lobbied Herndon officials to use taxpayer money to build a regulated day laborer center in an old police station at the edge of town. This they say would get the day-laborer group(s) off the street. The plan has the backing of Herndon mayor, Michael L. O'Reilly.

The plan would also combine the opening of the center with a new local ordinance that would make it a misdemeanor crime for a laborer to seek work at any location other than the official one. Opponents of the plan say the town would be aiding illegal immigrants if it established the center.

A Pew Hispanic Center survey found a 25% increase over four years in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The number now is estimated to have reached about 10.3 million. Local governments do not have the authority to enforce national immigration laws, so the town of Herndon must rely on federal officials, who show little interest in getting involved."

Helsingin Sanomat said it was unable to verify the authenticity of the photos, but added that they could be genuine because the men involved are still serving in the army.
The paper said the photos showed conscripts being forced to strip naked and perform sexual acts on each other.

In the images, released through Internet forums, soldiers are humiliated by their officers, being forced to act like dogs with other soliders holding their leashes. The Defence Forces communications director Ossi Kervinen considers the matter unfortunate.

The images are strikingly similar to those that came out of the Abu Ghraib prison last year.

He also admitted that he lied to federal agents about his contacts with al Qaeda operatives.
Brinkema said she would sentence Moussaoui to life in prison without parole if","six charges of conspiracy laid against him for his plotting to participate in the Sept. 11 attacks.

19 hijackers took control of four planes on September 11, 2001. Nearly four weeks before the attack, Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota on immigrations charges having raised the suspicions of instructors at a flight school.

During the attack, two planes were flown into the World Trade Center buildings, a third struck the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, USA."

"As they have done for the last four years, United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientists were measuring an approximate 100 square","mile area of the earth’s surface in the western part of the state.
The surveyors are using a specialized instrument called a “ground penetrating radar” to measure the thickness of the ice and snow on the ground. The data will be used by the National Weather Service to help predict future weather patterns.

Paden says the information gathered from the survey will also be used to determine how much water is stored","mile bulge in central Oregon near the South Sister this past August. The bulge is located 25 miles outside of the city of Bend, Ore. and three miles from the South Sister.

The results of this years survey won't be available for some weeks, but geologists have come to some conclusions based on the past four years of monitoring. The intial discovery was made by using information from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Interferometric Satellite Aperture Radar satellite. Scientists believe the bulge is rising at a rate of 1.4 inches per year and is due to a large lake of fluid (likely magma) that is 4.5 miles below the surface. They also think the fluid covers an area about one mile across and extends to a depth of 65 feet. The pooling fluid could be shifting magma or the creation of a new volcano.

Ground swells aren't an extraodinary occurrence in geology. Geologists suspect that these ground swellings occur in the Cascade Range and at other volcanoes, and the majority of them do not lead to eruptions. Using the same ESA satellite technology, geologists have seen lots of bulges in the Aleutian Islands that have not lead to eruptions."

TAROM currently operates three weekly flights between Bucharest and London Heathrow Airport.","arest, the Romanian capital, to Arad, a city in the country's west, will be cancelled, due to lack of financial viability and an increase in competition. The reason for the cancellation is mainly due to the planned inauguration on May 16 of a Bucharest-Arad flight operated by the private airline Carpatair, Romania's second-largest airline.

Carpatair has grown very quicly in the past two years, adding several new destinations, both in Romania and abroad. Also, it has taken away many of TAROM's customers on international routes because it provides direct connections from Transylvanian cities such as Arad and Timişoara to German and Italian cities, saving customers the task of changing flights at Bucharest. Also, although Carpatair started out as a Transylvanian airline, it now also flies to destinations in Romania's east, and is expected to open up new routes via Bucharest, in a further attempt to compete with TAROM and win more market share.

While the jury did take 11 days to arrive at their decision, they found Kozlowski and Swartz guilty on 22 of the 23 counts. To combat the aggressive jury selection strategy undertaken by the defense, the prosecution ""basically gave the jury several credit hours worth of an MBA"", teaching them about following paper trails and detecting falsification of business records.

A World Health Organization (WHO) committee comprising of 43 African health ministers has declared a tuberculosis emergency on the,"continent.
The declaration was made at the end of a two-day meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which was attended by representatives from 25 countries.
According to WHO, the meeting was convened to discuss the rising number of TB cases and deaths in Africa.
“We are facing an unprecedented threat,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “TB is one of the top three causes of death globally, and it is the leading cause of death for people living with HIV.”
In 201","continent.

The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in African countries per year has quadrupled since 1990, and continues to rise. Now 540,000 people die of the disease in Africa every year.

Worldwide, TB kills two million people a year; the only deadlier disease in the world is HIV/AIDS.

Some African countries such as Tanzania and Malawi pioneered TB control strategies that were later adopted around the globe. But they were not successful - Malawi saw the number of TB cases a year rise by four times over the past 15 years. Poverty, poor health systems and HIV have been blamed by the WHO for this.

Funding is a particularly critical issue. Eight of the nine worst affected African countries reported that, for 2003, they had short-falls in the funding their TB control programmes needed. However the WHO stresses that money alone will not end the crisis - health systems must be improved, and the rate at which health professionals are lost in the region must be reduced.

Africa is the only region in the world to be experiencing an increase in TB cases - in the rest of the world, infection rates are either stable or falling."

In Gaza City, Palestinian gunmen fired on an Israeli patrol, wounding one soldier. In another incident, a Palestinian shot at an Israeli tank from a rooftop in Rafah, but missed.
Israeli troops also arrested two Palestinians in Heb","uce, already threatened after militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad announced that they were not bound by the agreement.

Two Israeli motorists escaped uninjured in the West Bank today after coming under fire from Palestinian gunmen.

Elsewhere, Hamas militant Hassan Alami was found dead in the Khan Younis camp of Southern Gaza, killed while carrying out activities for the group. Although Hamas refused to be bound by the agreement signed yesterday in Sharm el-Sheik, it has promised to keep quiet at the request of Mahmoud Abbas.

Another Palestinian man is in a critical condition after being shot in the chest. The man, from the Rafah refugee camp, was shot near the Israeli settlement of Atzmona. The Israeli army, which has a garrison in Atzmona, is looking into the incident.

Meanwhile, Ramallah has accused Lebanese rebel group Hezbollah of attempting to sabotage the fragile peace agreement in the Middle East. The group, backed by Syria and Iran, are attempting to recruit Palestinian militants to engage in attacks of Israeli targets, claim Palestinian spokesmen. The charges mirror those made recently by Israel, which has long accused Hezbollah of bankrolling Palestinian violence in the region.

Hezbollah denies the charges, and claims to be honouring the ceasefire agreed yesterday. However, Palestinian officials claim to have intercepted bank records and email communications that prove that the guerilla group is recruiting militants in the West Bank. Abbas is shying away from any confrontation with the group at the moment, but has sent an envoy to Beirut to persuade Hezbollah to desist from its aggressive activities.

Despite the setbacks, Israel has begun to lift restrictions of travel and issue permits to 1000 Palestinians to work in Israel, as part of Tuesday's deal. Sharon has agreed to travel to Ramallah to continue talks toward peace in the region."

Al-Zawahri also warned other nations to leave Muslim lands to avoid further violence. He was quoted as saying: ""What you have seen, O Americans, in New York and Washington and the losses you are having in Afghanistan and Iraq, in spite of all the media blackout, are only the losses of the initial clashes, If you continue the same policy of aggression against Muslims, God willing, you will see the horror that will make you forget what you had seen in Vietnam.""

Tony Blair has denied that his policies caused the July 7 bomb attacks. Downing Street has refused to comment on the tape.

A man accused of driving under the influence of alcohol stuffed his mouth full of feces in a failed attempt to foil the police breathaly,"zer test, according to court documents.
The incident occurred on July 21 when officers pulled over a car driven by 30-year-old Michael D. Huffman for speeding and failing to signal a turn.
Huffman was arrested after he allegedly failed a field sobriety test and refused to take a breathalyzer test.
According to an arrest affidavit, Huffman told officers that he had been drinking at a bar before getting behind the wheel. He also said he had eaten some fried chicken and drank a beer while waiting for the","zer.

The man was arrested Sunday by South Simcoe Police after his pickup truck was pulled over on Ontario Provincial Highway 11 in Stroud, Ontario, Canada. On the way to the police station for testing, the 59-year-old vomited, urinated, and defecated in the police cruiser. Sgt.

He was charged with impaired driving and driving over the limit and was released on a promise to appear in a Bradford, Ontario court on May 12."
"Guidant Corporation recently announced another safety warning on several models of its implantable defibrillators, cautioning users for the second time in","less than a year. The company said that some of its implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) may be at risk of malfunctioning due to a manufacturing defect.
The ICDs are used to treat patients with abnormal heart rhythms and can deliver an electrical shock to restore normal heartbeat. The devices are implanted under the skin near the chest wall.
Guidant’s latest warning involves 10,000 ICDs sold between 2003 and 2005. The company said that the devices could fail","a week about the devices. No patients are known to have been injured by the devices at this time. This brings the total number of defibrillator models recalled to twelve.

According to the Associated Press article, the five defibrillator models recalled ""have a magnetic switch that can become stuck in a closed position, preventing the device from treating irregular heart rhythms. The faulty switch also can limit a defibrillator's battery life.""

American manufacturing giant Proctor &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) plans to acquire Gillette Co. for US$5,"7 billion in stock, the companies announced on Monday.
The deal will create a company with combined sales of about $60 billion and annual earnings of more than $12 billion, P&amp;G said. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2005.
""This combination creates an unparalleled portfolio of brands that will enable us to better serve our consumers around the world,"" A.G. Lafley, chairman and CEO of P&amp;G, said in a statement. ""We are confident that this combination will deliver significant value to share","7 billion in stock. The purchase plan calls for P&amp;G to swap 0.975 shares of its stock per share of Gillete Co. P&amp;G also announced a stock buyback program in which they would purchase up to US$22 billion of shares over the next 18 months. Including the stock buyback program, the merger is being financed by 60 percent stock and 40 percent cash.

P&amp;G is known for brands such as Ariel and Tide washing powder, Max Factor cosmetics, Pringles potato crisps (chips) and Hugo Boss and Lacoste perfumes.

Gillette, known for brands such as Gillette razors, Oral B dental care, and Duracell batteries, has had growing problems with the growth of private labels and price cuts demanded by large supermarkets.

After the acquisition is completed, Gillette's CEO James Kilts will be P&amp;G's vice-chairman. Kilts said that he expects that this acquisition will cause additional mergers to take place.

""I believe the consumer product industry needs to consolidate,"" said Kilts, ""we believe we can bring these companies together and create a juggernaut.""

P&amp;G and Gillette have a combined market capitalization of about $185 billion US, which will make it the largest in the sector.

The early morning announcement states that 6,000 employees will be eliminated. Most of the layoffs will result from reducing overlapping management positions and other supporting positions within the combined company.

Antitrust regulators in the US and Europe plan to review the acquisition, to determine whether the combined company will have too much power over pricing and shelf space.

P&amp;G plans to provide additional details about the merger Friday morning (East Coast time) in New York."
Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was officially placed under house arrest a day after the country's Supreme Court upheld his,"detention on charges of human rights violations.
The 91-year-old former general, who has been in poor health for several years, is accused of ordering the murder and torture of thousands of people during his 17-year rule.
He had been held at Santiago's military hospital since he was arrested last October.
His lawyers have said they will appeal against the decision to keep him in custody.
Pinochet's lawyer, Juan Guzman, told reporters that the former leader would be taken to a private clinic where he could receive medical","indictment of one count of murder and nine counts of kidnapping.

Court officials say the arrest order was delivered to Gen. Pinochet's home near the capital, Santiago, Wednesday. The 89-year-old retired general has been at his home recovering from a stroke he suffered in late December.

A government commission, the Rettig Commission, listed 2,095 deaths and 1,102 disappearances during his 17-year rule. In 2004 the Valech Report that was issued after interviewing an estimated 35,000 people who claimed to have been abused by the regime; 28,000 were regarded legitimate.

The crimes were allegedly committed as part of Operation Condor, a campaign of assassination and terrorization meant to suppress left-wing opposition to Pinochet's regime. The Chilean-led program soon spread to other military regimes throughout Latin America, and may have had at least tacit complicity by then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The Pinochet dictatorship ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990, gaining power after a military coup overthrew the democratically-elected socialist President Salvador Allende."
"Berlin's Neukoellner Opera House is causing a stir with its new production, The Yellow Princess.

The story presented in the","opera is based on the life of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1837–1898), who was known as Sisi. She was born into the Bavarian royal family and married Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.

## Synopsis

The opera begins with the death of Empress Elisabeth of Austria. Her husband, Emperor Franz Joseph I, is devastated by her loss. He has her body embalmed and placed in a glass coffin. In his grief, he decides to have a statue made of her.

In the second act, the sculptor is working on","French opera, by Camille Saint-Saens, is of an artist ""whose life is dictated by a love for drugs and Japan."" As a result, the performers smoke cannabis joints on stage, and the theatre itself is encouraging the audience to join in.

Artistic director Bernhard Glocksin says that the theatre is claiming the metaphorical ""artistic licence"", to excuse the actions of the actors and audience, which are against German law. Glocksin was quoted by Ananova as saying opera would be ""improved with a few joints and some appetising lines"", noting the production was partly an experiment, to see what they could ""get away with.""

""Artistic licence"" is at par to an ""artistic liberty"", where something is exaggerated or changed for the sake of the art itself. For example a visual artist painting a landscape might move a tree to another area of their work, for better balance, or a poet ignoring pentameter when writing a traditional sonnet."
"A chemical part of the saliva of a poisonous lizard, the Gila monster, has become an integral partner in the control of Type ","2 diabetes.

“We have identified a new class of compounds that can be used to treat Type 2 diabetes,” said senior author Peter Tontonoz, MD, professor of pediatrics and director of the UCSD Diabetes Research Center. “These compounds are derived from a natural product found in the venom of the Gila monster.”

Chinese media and former ROC President and spiritual leader of the pro-independence TSU Lee Teng-hui (李登輝,") have been criticized for their comments on Taiwan’s 2016 presidential election.
The China Times, a newspaper owned by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), said that Lee’s remarks were “unacceptable” and “a serious violation of the law.” The paper also accused Lee of trying to influence the outcome of the election.
Lee was quoted as saying in an interview with the United Daily News that he would not vote for any candidate who did not support independence. He also said that if Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) won the presidency",") responded on Monday to the massive rally held Saturday in Taipei.

In mainland China, the China Daily published an editorial under the headline, ""March sets stage for secessionist scheming"" in which it labeled the rally as ""secessionist scheming"" and a ""misuse of people power"".

China Daily said of President Chen that, ""his participation in the protest added to his record as a man of bad faith. Only one month ago, Chen solemnly pledged to develop cross-Straits relations during his meeting with PFP chairman James Soong. Unfortunately he has failed to honour his word.""

In Taiwan, former President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) asked for the ROC government to follow up on the large turnout with concrete measures.

The Taipei Times quoted Lee, ""The March 26 march ended perfectly, yet it wasn't just the close of a political carnival."" Lee continued, ""It was a new starting point for consolidating people's identification with Taiwan and declaring the Taiwanese people's strong will to defend their right of self-determination.""
""That 1 million Taiwanese people came out was a display of the mainstream of Taiwanese public opinion, and officials should respond to that with practical actions and policies,"" Lee told a symposium. ""Otherwise the march will just have been emotional venting, which won't solve the current cross-strait problems.""

Lee made his remarks at the Taiwan Advocates symposium."

"The new leader of Togo, the late president Gnassingbé Eyadéma's son, Faure Gnassingb","é, has been sworn in as president.
The ceremony took place at a stadium in Lome on Thursday.
Mr Gnassingbé was elected by parliament last week after his father died in February.
He had been expected to take over from his father in 2005 but was forced into exile when he tried to seize power.
His return to Togo was met with protests and violence, which left more than 100 people dead.
Mr Gnassingbé was re-elected in April, amid allegations of fraud.","é, pledged to hold ""free and transparent elections which reflect the will of the people"" as soon as possible, though he did not mention a specific timeframe, nor did he address international criticism of his ascession to power.

Togolese politics have become a subject of criticism by the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations after the death of Eyadéma late last week. Eyadéma was Africa's longest-ruling leader whose 38-year rule was marked by government-sponsored violence and the stifling of political expression.

The Constitution of Togo was amended to permit Eyadéma to retain power, to allow more than two five-year terms in office, and to lower the minimum age for a president from 45 to 35. The latter move was seen as a way to allow the succession of the presidency to Eyadéma's son, then only 35 years old.

When Eyadéma died on Saturday of a heart attack, the country's Constitution called for power to be transferred to the head of the national assembly. Instead, Faure Gnassingbé assumed power and the Constitution was amended to allow this, causing criticism from foreign commentators.

Faure Gnassingbé also promised reforms, and an open dialog with the opposition parties. However, with the opposition leader out of the country since an assassination attempt in 1992, and the presidential term not set to expire until 2008, it is not clear how much change these promises will bring in the near future."

The post became available after the previous Secretary General, Miguel Ángel Rodriguez, served for only 24 days of his term of office, before returning home to Costa Rica to face corruption charges.

Luigi R. Einaudi, the former Assistant Secretary General, is serving as Acting Secretary General until the OAS decides who will serve for the remainder of the current term of office.

Before Menchú was nominated, the Central American states had decided that the candidate should be from Central America. But the Rodriguez scandal has made it difficult for the Central American states to find another candidate they could all endorse.

Chile and Mexico have proposed their own candidate for the job.

President Oscar Berger of Guatemala agrees that Menchú should be the Central American candidate. Menchú has said that if the Central American nations are in agreement, she will happily stand as their candidate.

An indigenous Guatemalan, Menchú won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, and was also prominent in her opposition to the previous FRG government which Berger defeated.

Menchú works for the current government as Good Will Ambassador for the 1996 peace accord.

"The investigations into the 1994 Rwandan genocide should be completed by the end of July, according to a spokesp","erson for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).
The ICTR was established in November 1994 to try those responsible for the mass killings that took place during the 100-day period following the assassination of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana.
The tribunal has indicted 38 people and is currently trying 26 suspects.

The courts were set up three years ago, however so far their time has been taken up with trial runs.

The IFI also expressed concern about taxpayer money being used to promote the event.

Although Gay Games spokeswoman Tracy Baim she said she was not surprised by the reversal of the five commissioners, Mike Quigley, a Democrat Cook County Commissioner said of the retraction of his colleagues, ""It's a blinding bias and animosity that is overriding human interest, job creation, economic development and the whole spirit of athletic competition."" Quigley was the sponsor of the proclamation and plans to play ice hockey in the games.

""The South African Mediation stated that it will continue its efforts, with the support of the United Nations and the African Union, to ensure the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in Côte d'Ivoire as scheduled, which is the only solution to the crisis,"" the Security Council said in a statement following the meeting.

The next round of elections are scheduled for the end of October although it is widely believed this date is unlikely to be met.

The peace process in Cote d'Ivoire has been on shaky ground following the failure of the rebel forces to begin the disarmament process originally scheduled for 31 July. The rebels, led by the Forces Nouvelles, claimed that Ivorian President Gbagbo had failed to make the necessary legal reforms necessary to begin the disarmament.

Canadian military officials are being accused of covering up the use of the deadly chemical agent Agent Orange and other defoliants during the 1950,"s in Canada.
The allegations were made by a former member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, who claims that he was ordered to destroy documents relating to the use of the chemicals.
The man, who has asked not to be named, said that he was told to burn all records relating to the use of the chemicals at CFB Gagetown, New Brunswick, where he served as an airman from 1956 to 1958.
He also claimed that he was ordered to remove any reference to the use of the chemicals from his service record.

At a public meeting attended by at least 200 people, defence officials said only a small amount of the herbicide was used, over a total of seven days between 1966 and 1967 at the army base to clear foliage to prevent fires during artillery training and to clear the view for soldiers.

The American military was also given permission by the Canadian military to test Agent Orange, Agent Purple, and Agent White during the Vietnam War on less than 500 acres of the Canadian base.

Thursday’s public meeting followed in the aftermath of recent media reports that a U.S. army report indicated the use of Agent Purple, which is considered three-times more toxic than Agent Orange, as part of the spraying program.

When revelations about the use of Agent Purple first surfaced in mid-June, retired sergeant, Earl Graves, said, “They were out in the exercise area and the planes flew over spraying and they were told to just put ponchos over their head, that it wouldn’t hurt them.”

He said 170 soldiers in his regiment died of cancer and many of them died young.

At the public meeting held Thursday afternoon, angry and fearful civilians and veterans voiced fears that the chemicals were responsible for illnesses later developed.

Veteran John Chisholm said soldiers were told the sprays were harmless and to keep their mouths shut. “Now we found out this stuff here is killing us. No wonder all my buddies are dead.”

The Defence Department said Thursday that it was conducting tests to determine the dioxin level in the soil and consulting with the U.S. military to find out the exact carcinogen levels in the sprays used."
"WASHINTON D.C., USA – (Washington Post) A Washington Post report reveals a secret intelligence department created by the Pentagon ""","to monitor and influence public opinion abroad.""
The program, called Operation Mockingbird, was first reported in 1975 by Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post. It was later confirmed by CIA officials who said that it had been shut down in 1976.
But according to the new report, the operation is still active today.
""Mockingbird remains an official part of the Defense Department’s psychological operations or PSYOPS mission,"" writes Barton Gellman, author of the article.
Gellman says that the program has been used to spread propaganda and","directly responsive to tasking from Secretary of Defense"" Donald Rumsfeld. The report raises questions regarding the legality of the Strategic Support Branch, allegations disputed by Pentagon spokesperson Lawrence T. DiRita:

: ""...the Department is not attempting to 'bend' statutes to fit desired activities, as is suggested in this article.""

Sen. John McCain (R AZ) expects the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee to hold hearings on the issue. ""I'm always sorry to read about things in The Washington Post when they affect a committee that I am a member of.""

"In an interview by John D. O'Connor for the American magazine Vanity Fair, it was revealed that W. Mark Felt, a former","deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was the infamous Watergate source known as ""Deep Throat"".
The revelation came in the form of a question from O'Connor to Felt: ""Was Deep Throat you?"" Felt replied, ""Yes.""
In 1972, Felt had been appointed associate director of the FBI and became acting director when J. Edgar Hoover died in May 1972. He was fired in 1973 after being accused of leaking information to the press about the investigation","associate director of the FBI during the Nixon Administration, was the anonymous informer called ""Deep Throat"". ""Deep Throat"" helped journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bring down then-president Richard Milhous Nixon through the exposure of the Watergate scandal.

Previously bound by a pledge not to reveal ""Deep Throat's"" identity until after his death, Woodward and Bernstein at first refused to confirm the Vanity Fair report. However, in a story posted late today on the Washington Post website, they verified that Felt was ""Deep Throat.""

However, one of Richard Nixon's biographers, Jonathan Aitken, believes that at least one of ""Deep Throat's"" tips could not have been known by Felt. The Post first reported on the famous 18 1/2 minute gap in a crucial tape at a time when only six people were aware of its existence -- none of them Felt. This raises the possibility that ""Deep Throat,"" though mainly based on Felt, may be a composite character.

Felt has been mentioned as a leading candidate for ""Deep Throat"" by many that have tried to solve the mystery. An article published in the American Journalism Review last fall claimed Carl Bernstein's son once exposed Felt as the mysterious informer. But until now, Felt, Woodward, Bernstein and the Post's former editor Ben Bradlee have all denied it.

Felt, 91, has reportedly been in poor health in recent years. His family says Felt admits to being the source and described him as feeling proud of his role in history and having ""a big grin"" when told of the Vanity Fair article."

This page was last edited on 15 January 2019, at 18:34 (UTC).","deeply controversial.

The processes and terms of reference of such 'Public' Inquiries are normally determined by the commissioning governmental body. However the Internet has now made possible the emergence of a new type of Public Inquiry, called an ""E-Inquiry"" that appears to be not only independent of government but also, like a Wiki, enables anyone who wishes to partake in the Inquiry to do so by contributing evidence and by posing questions that contribute to the process of determining the Terms of reference of the E-Inquiry.

The absence of a US government sponsored independent public inquiry into the Katrina hurricane disaster could well be the spur that led to the development of a new non-profit web site that incorporates a framework for conducting a Public E-Inquiry. That site http://www.ForumKatrina.org carries the banner line ""Katrina Support, Recovery, Planning &amp; E-Inquiry"".

The web site owners have given permission to quote the following extract from its statement on the web site about the objective of its E-Inquiry:

""Everyone who may think of getting involved in the E-Inquiry is asked to remember, at every stage in the process, that the end purpose of the E-Inquiry is to provide recommendations, for the future. The objective of those recommendations is to help everyone to avoid death, disease and destruction in consequence of forthcoming natural and man-made disasters. If those recommendations are to be taken seriously, and this, the first E-Inquiry, is to acquire any public credibility, then the process must be democratic, patently fair and intellectually rigorous.""

It will be interesting to see whether an E-Inquiry is capable of meeting these ideals and whether they become a common feature of internet activity."

The report emphasized that Annan knowingly allowed Saddam Hussein to continue making huge unethical profits off of the program.

While Annan acknowledged that there was blame to pass around, he stated that ""None of us -- member states, Secretariat, agencies, funds and programs -- can be proud of what it has found."" Annan also says that he was at least partly at fault for the corruption; ""The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism.""

On a lighter note, while the report is critical of Annan, it also says that the Oil for Food program did help get food to many Iraqis."

The vote was held after an unprecedented campaign by thousands of people across Europe who signed petitions, wrote letters and made phone calls to their MEPs. The result is a huge victory for the open source community, which has long opposed the CII directive.
""This is a great day for free software,"" said Karsten Gerloff, president of the Free Software Foundation Europe. ""We are very happy that our voice has","to reject the proposal, aimed at bringing Europe in-line with a similar U.S. bill.

"Romania's Ministry of European Integration has made public the text of the European Union's Accession Treaty with Romania and Bulgaria,","which was signed in Luxembourg on 25 April.
The treaty will be submitted to the Parliament for ratification by both countries. The Romanian parliament is expected to approve it in June.
The treaty contains a number of provisions that are not included in the accession treaties of other EU member states. These include:
- A provision allowing Romania to opt out from the Schengen Agreement;
- A provision allowing Romania to opt out from the Dublin II Regulation;
- A provision allowing Romania to opt out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union","making it available on its website. The text of the treaty is available freely, in Romanian, at .

The Accession Treaty, which is due to be voted by the European Parliament on April 13 and signed on April 25, is the legal document facilitating Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the EU, which, according to the treaty, will take place on January 1, 2007.

The treaty's content has been posted online in order to inform Romanians of the costs, standards and responsibilities of European Union accession. The text was published after the European Commission asked for Romania and Bulgaria to better inform their citizens of what EU accession actually means. Bulgaria similarly made available the content of the treaty, in the Bulgarian language, in early April.

Once the Accession Treaty is signed, Romania and Bulgaria will have to withdraw from the Central European Free Trade Agreement, as they will be integrated into the EU-wide free trade area. Additionally, from April 25, the two countries will send observers to the European Parliament and will be able to participate in other European Union institutions and events as observers.

When the two countries join in 2007, the European Union will have 27 members in total and more than 480 million citizens. The timetable for accession, and the implementation of the treaty, however, will be in jeopardy if the European Parliament fails to approve the accession of the two countries on April 13, or if the two countries are deemed unprepared for accession by the European Commission, in which case the so-called safeguard clause will come into effect, postponing accession by one year."

She replaces Mr Tunde Fashola, who was recently appointed governor of Lagos state.
Mr Fashola's appointment had been widely expected, but his replacement was not.
Mrs Osomo was appointed to the post in 2003, when she became the first woman to hold the position.

"Dr. Stephen Schoenthaler, a Professor of Criminal Justice at the California State University in Stanislaus, has long argued that there is a","direct correlation between crime and poverty. He says that if you want to reduce crime, you need to reduce poverty.
In 2013, he published an article in The Crime Report entitled “The Real Reason for Crime: Poverty.” In it, he wrote:
“Poverty is the root cause of crime. It’s not just one factor among many. It’s the only factor. If we could eliminate poverty, we would eliminate crime.”
He also said that the United States spends $50 billion per year on criminal justice, but only $7 billion on anti","link between a healthy diet and decreased aggressive behaviour, as well as with increased IQ and school performance.

Dr. Schoenthaler is well-known for a youth detention center study where violations of house rules fell by 37% when vending machines were removed and the cafeteria replaced canned food by fresh alternatives. He summarizes his findings by saying that “Having a bad diet right now is a better predictor of future violence than past violent behaviour.” In a very large test, Schoenthaler directed a study in meals at 803 New York City schools, in low-income neighbourhoods, finding that the number of students passing final exams increased by 16%.

Critics have questioned some of Dr. Schoenthaler findings, due to the lack of placebo control groups. However, more recent work by Dr. Bernard Gesch, a physiologist at the University of Oxford, has placed some of the work on a more scientific footing. Dr. Gesch found that nutrition supplements produced a 26% drop in violations of prison rules over a placebo, and a 37% decrease in violent offences. The Netherlands has embarked on a wider scale dietary research program in 14 prisons.

The short term behaviour consequences of ingesting sugar are well understood: an initial burst on energy, followed a sugar low in which your body produces adrenalin, which makes you irritable and explosive. However, Schoenthaler and Gesch suggest that there are long term impacts over and above the short term consequences of blood sugar variations."

England's reply was led by Joe Root who scored 107 not out from 169 balls. He shared partnerships of 182 with Jonny Bairstow (60) and 102 with Jos Buttler (59).

## Background

The match was played at Edgbaston, which had hosted the first Test of the series. The pitch was expected to be similar to that","came close to victory themselves, however Steven Harminson took the wicket of Michael Kasprovic to clinch victory on the fourth day of the game.

The match looked to be in Englands hands following sterling batting from Kevin Pietersen (71, 20) and Andrew Flintoff (68, 73) which left the Australians needing to score 282 to win the match. The tourists were soon in trouble ending the third day at 175-8 with over 100 runs still to score and only 2 wickets in hand.

However on the fourth morning the Australian tailenders scored steadily and despite the loss of Shane Warne for 42 the final wicket pair closed in on the target.

The Edgbaston crowd were reduced to biting their nails as the match came down to the wire; Australia needing just 3 runs to win and England needing just one wicket.

Harmison produced a lifting delivery from just short of a length which Kasprovic could only fend off with a glove through to the England 'keeper Geraint Jones, leaving Australia agonisingly short of a memorable win and the series all square at one match each with three to play.

Scores: England 407 and 182, Australia 308 and 279"
"In Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin adopted the following resolution at their state convention:

:CALLING ON THE UN","ITED STATES CONGRESS TO PASS A BILL OF RIGHTS FOR WOMEN

WHEREAS, the United States Constitution was written in 1789 and has been amended 26 times since then; and

WHEREAS, the United States Constitution does not contain a Bill of Rights for women; and

WHEREAS, the United States Constitution does not contain a provision that guarantees equal rights to all citizens regardless of race, color, religion, sex or national origin; and

WHEREAS, the United States Constitution does not contain a provision that guarantees equal pay for","ITED STATES CONGRESS TO INITIATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST PRESIDENT BUSH, VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY AND DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS

:WHEREAS, the Downing Street Memo shows that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld began planning and executing the war on Iraq before seeking Congressional and UN approval;

:WHEREAS, UN weapons inspectors showed prior to the invasion that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; and

:WHEREAS, there is further mounting evidence that the Administration lied or misled about ""mushroom clouds,"" ""connections to 9/11,"" and ""war as a last resort"" as they sought UN, Congressional, and public approvals;

:THEREFORE, RESOLVED, the DPW asks Congress to immediately begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.

The resolution alleges that the Bush administration ""lied or misled"" Congress and the American people concerning the justification for the war. The ""Downing Street memo"" and reports from U.N. weapons inspectors are mentioned as evidence of deception.

Newly elected state party Chairman Joe Wineke said, ""Democrats, not only in Wisconsin but throughout the U.S., have been outraged by what we believe has been a clear cover-up of why the U.S. went into Iraq,"" and that the resolution expresses ""the sense of frustration that Democrats in Wisconsin have over fighting a war for the wrong reasons.""

Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor, does not think the resolution will be successful and said that even if the House of Representatives began impeachment proceedings against the president and vice president, ""I don't think you can impeach the secretary of defense""."
"Rebels from the Hutu-extremist ""Forces Nationales de Liberation"" have shot dead six churchgoers in Muhuta",", a village near the Rwandan border.
The killings took place on Sunday as people were leaving a Catholic church after mass.
The rebels are fighting to overthrow the government of President Paul Kagame.
Rwanda's Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo said that the rebels had crossed into Rwanda and killed the villagers.
She told Reuters news agency: ""They came across the border and they attacked the population.""
Muhuta is about 10km (six miles) from the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi.
The","district, Bujumbura-Rural, according to army spokesman Adolphe Manirakiza.

""The first criminal attack was committed in one church at Muhuta district where a group of FNL fighters fired in the church and killed six people including a pastor. They also injured seven others"", Manirakiza said.

He said the rebels shot dead a local government official and his brother and also kidnapped a policeman in the same district.

""We don't know yet why these people were killed, they may be executed because they refused to adhere to the FNL ideology, as the area where they have been killed is an FNL stronghold.""

Some 300,000 people have been killed since the fighting began in 1993.

Fresh talks between the government and the FNL have raised hopes among diplomats that Burundi can finally lift one of its last big barriers to peace.

Its leader Agathon Rwasa and Burundi President, Domitien Ndayizeye signed on May 15 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a cessation of hostilities deal seen as a significant step toward finally bringing the rebels into the peace process.

But the rebels and the army have clashed sporadically since the truce."
The Mozilla Foundation released the second major security update this week for their flagship browser Firefox. The fix patches a serious flaw in the way Firefox,"handles PDF files, which could allow an attacker to execute malicious code on your computer.
The vulnerability is present in all versions of Firefox from 3.0 up to and including version 4.0.1. If you are running an older version of Firefox, you should upgrade immediately.
The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at Secunia, who have rated it as “highly critical”.
If you are using Firefox, make sure that you have installed the latest version of the browser. You can do so by clicking on the Help menu and selecting About Firefox.
You will then be presented","handles animated GIF image files. Firefox browsers infected by malicious code could experience a buffer overflow, temporarily locking up or ""freezing"" a user's computer, or even executing arbitrary code which could take over a user's computer.

The flaw was discovered and reported by Internet Security Systems, Inc. The upgrade was the second major security fix in less than a month for the browser, which has grown in popularity to ten percent of the browser market in the United States.

Although there were no known exploits of the bug, Chris Hoffman, director of engineering at Mozilla, told reporters, ""because Mozilla is committed to delivering the most secure product possible, we decided to quickly issue an update to patch the bug.""

The Mozilla Foundation did not offer any details about the issue of vulnerability, but a second major security overhaul in such a short time underscores challenges faced by the nonprofit foundation as it goes head-to-head with the market leading Internet Explorer browser by Microsoft.

The new release, Firefox version 1.0.2, ""illustrates the dedication of the strong community of developers working on the product,"" according to Hoffman. ""...we’re able to turn around patches much faster than a traditional corporation,"" he added.

Users can download the update at no charge, and can find additional information at the Mozilla website."
Despite assurances from the European Commissioner for the Internal Market Charles McCreevy that the Council would adopt its controversial Common Position text covering Software,"Patents on 12th December, it has now been confirmed that this will not happen.
The reason given is that the Council of Ministers have decided to postpone the adoption of the text until after the next meeting of the Competitiveness Council in January. This means that the Council will not be able to adopt the text before the end of the year as originally planned.
This delay is a major setback for those who want to see software patents introduced in Europe and is likely to lead to further delays in the process. The Council had hoped to use the December meeting to approve the text and","Patents, members voted to restart the entire process with a new directive.

MEP Michel Rocard noted several ""inelegancies"" by the Commission in his speech against the directive, such as not taking into account any of the Parliament's substantive amendments in its recommendation to the Council. He also took the Dutch and German governments to task for ignoring their respective parliaments. The Irish Presidency's sponsorship by Microsoft was also criticised, as were the attempted ratifications at fishery Council meetings.

There was also confusion over the actual effects of the proposed directive with industry players confirming that the Council text allowed pure software patents, while the Commission claimed it would not.

""In the debate, broad agreement prevailed over the fact that the current proposal was counter-productive and far from a good basis for a decision,"" said Italian MEP Monica Frassoni.

The computer-implemented inventions directive was voted down by members of European Parliament (MEP) in the legal affairs committee. 19 MEPs voted in favour of re-starting negotiations, 2 against with one abstention."
"Bobby Abreu, welcome to the spotlight.

The Philadelphia Phillies star, now 31 and a two-time All-Star",", is finally getting his due.

Abreu's numbers are impressive: .296 batting average, 104 runs scored, 25 home runs, 87 RBIs, 10 stolen bases. He has been one of the best hitters in baseball this season.

But it's not just the numbers that have made him so valuable to the Phillies. It's also his versatility.

He can play all three outfield positions, he can bat anywhere from first to ninth in the lineup, and he can be used",", has produced well for the Phillies over the last half a decade without the glamour of other top players. However, last night there was no denying that he was the star of the show.

And what a show it was. The first batter in the 2005 Home Run Derby, Abreu proceeded to shatter the previous record of 15 home runs in a round, belting 24, including a 517-foot moonshot that exited the stadium in right field, going through two bats in the process. This rampage came immediately after ESPN announcers Chris Berman and Joe Morgan described Comerica Park, the site of the Derby, as a difficult park to hit home runs in.

In the second round, Abreu edged past Boston's David Ortiz (who himself hit an astounding 17 homeruns in the first round) and Milwaukee's Carlos Lee to earn a spot in the finals alongside Detroit star Ivan Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who snuck into the second round with 7 dingers, swatted the most in the second round, but his home-field advantage deserted him in the finals as Abreu smashed 11 over the fences to win the Derby for his native Venezuela.

Abreu's three-round total of 41 homers broke Miguel Tejada's record of 27, set last year in Houston's Minute Maid Park."

"Blogshine Sunday, a national effort among webloggers to publicize the importance of open access to government information is scheduled to take place on March","25.
The event was organized by the Sunlight Foundation and the American Library Association. The idea behind the event is to raise awareness about the need for open access to government information.
Bloggers are encouraged to post about the issue on their blogs on March 25.
For more information, visit http://www.blogshinesunday.org/.","13, 2005.

On that day, FreeCulture.org will organize web-based writers to relate their experiences and thoughts on open-access to governmental records and freely available public information. Webloggers will be encouraged to highlight the need to have public records available in electronic formats to facilitate easier searching of information and more widespread access. Another goal of Blogshine Sunday is to emphasize that open access to governmental information should be granted to everyone, unpaid reporters and bloggers as well as professional journalists.

Recently, bloggers have played an important role in shaping public opinion about issues that were initially overlooked by traditional media. Freerepublic.com blogger Harry W. MacDougald was the first to scrutinize documents that suggested that President Bush was derelict in his military service in the 1970s. CBS News reported on the documents as if they were legitimate, but MacDougald discovered that the documents used a typestyle that was not available at the time they were supposedly written. Following MacDougald’s blog posts questioning the documents, CBS said that they regretted reporting on the documents as though they were authentic. Since bloggers are generally unpaid and do not have the editorial restrictions of professional journalists, as the MacDougald example illustrates, they are sometimes better able to research and report on issues not covered by traditional media.

Blogshine Sunday is held in conjunction with Sunshine Sunday, when professional journalists and news media will publish articles and editorials on the importance of the open records. Freeculture.org was started last April by two college students in an effort to show that technology can better facilitate public affairs involvement. More information on Blogshine Sunday can be found at: BlogShine.org"
Schapelle Corby was today found guilty by an Indonesian court for the importation of 4 kilograms of marijuana to Bali,"in 2004.
The verdict, which came after a trial that lasted more than two years, means she will be sentenced on Monday and could face up to 20 years in jail.
Corby's lawyer, Nicky Davis, said he would appeal against the conviction.
""We are very disappointed with the verdict,"" Mr Davis told reporters outside the Denpasar District Court.
""We have always maintained her innocence.""
He said he had not yet seen the verdict but expected it to be handed down at 1pm (AEST)",". She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The verdict was handed down by three judges amidst tight security at the Denpasar District Court.

The verdict was read in Indonesian and relayed to Corby via her translator. The court erupted as the outcome became clear. Her family and supporters screamed at the judge, and said that justice had not been done. ""Scheppelle is innocent!"" one supporter said.

Her lawyer reported before the verdict was handed down that she was terrified. ""She's probably the worst I've ever seen her,"" he said.

After the verdict she stopped briefly to hug her family before being loaded into a van and driven away.

Corby was arrested at Denpasar Airport last October. On her trip to Bali, she flew from Brisbane to Sydney and then changed planes. Her defense centered around the claim that Australian airport baggage handlers placed the drugs in her bodyboard bag as part of a drug smuggling ring. It was claimed that the drugs were being smuggled from Brisbane to Sydney, but for some reason were not removed before her luggage was transferred to the Indonesian flight.

After a lengthy trial that attracted much media attention in Australia, prosecutors called for the judges to hand down a life sentence.
Schapelle Corby
Hundreds of supporters and friends gathered at Tugun Surf-Lifesaving Club on the Gold Coast to watch the verdict and show their support.

Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that he felt for Corby but that Australians had to trust the Indonesian justice system. ""We have to respect the justice system of other countries,"" he said.

The judge said she had until next Wednesday to appeal."

The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is deploying its new Homeland Security Information Network - Secret (HSIN-Secret) in,"the Washington, D.C., area to provide a secure communications network for federal, state and local government agencies.
The HSIN-Secret will be used by more than 100,000 users from 25 federal, state and local agencies, including the FBI, CIA, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Secret Service, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, U.S. Transport","all 50 state Emergency Operations Centers as well as 18 additional state and local law enforcement sites. ""The secret network is a component of the HSIN, which is the primary conduit for DHS to share information on terrorist threats, suspicious activity and incident management with state, local, tribal and private-sector officials."" reports Government Computer News.

Development on this $350 million system by Northrop Grumman Corporation was begun in March of 2004 with basic operation achieved in just 4 months.

""The Homeland is more secure when each hometown is more secure,"" said Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge in DHS's February 24, 2004 press release that launched the program. ""Future program expansion will include the county level, communication at the classified SECRET level, and the involvement of the private sector."" it continues.

HSIN lets most government agencies as well as many private companies doing business with the government share information on the whereabouts and suspicious activities of anyone that comes to their attention. Internal policies and the judgement of the system's users provide privacy and civil rights protections, while who can access the system is determined by DHS."
