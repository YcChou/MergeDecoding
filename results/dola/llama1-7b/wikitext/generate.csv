The third wave was led by Major George Lane, who had replaced Major Peter Young when he was wounded on 5 June.
The fourth wave was led by Major Mike Keogh, who had replaced Major Bill Fraser when he was wounded on 5 June.
The fifth wave","landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The Tetrarchs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "

" In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Copán , whose founder K 'inich Yax K 'uk","' Mo' was a descendant of the great king Pakal. The city had a population of about 20,000 and its rulers were able to control the trade routes between the Gulf coast and the highlands.
The Maya civilization is divided into three main periods: Preclassic (1800 BC–AD 250), Classic (AD 250–900) and Postclassic (AD 900–1524). The first period saw the development of complex societies in the lowlands of what is now southern Mexico and","' Mo ' was clearly connected with Tikal . Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal . K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Copán in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan . Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as "" Lord of the West "" , much like Siyah K ’ ak ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries . "

 The absence of any form of paving between the headstone rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs . Lawn paths add to the,"overall effect, and are a feature that is not found in other cemeteries.
The cemetery was designed by architects William Henry Goss-Strangways (1840–1923) and his son, William Henry Goss-Strangways Jr. (1876–1955). It was built on land donated by the Honourable John A. Macdonald, who also served as its first president.

" Temnospondyls ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . In living tetrapods , the main body of the vertebra is","called the centrum, and each segment is called a neural arch. The neural arches are connected by two pedicles (the front and back parts of the centrum) and an intercentrum (a small bone between the pedicles).
The neural arches are formed from the bodies of the vertebral arches, which are made up of the prezygapophyses and zygapophyses. The prezygapophyses are the projections on either side of the neural arch that connect to the ribs. The zygapophyses are the projections at the","a single piece of bone called the centrum , but in temnospondyls , this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum . Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls : stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae . In rhachitomous vertebrae , the intercentra are large and wedge @-@ shaped , and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them . Both elements support a spine @-@ like neural arch , and well @-@ developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae . The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially , and in some cases fully , terrestrial . In stereospondylous vertebrae , the pleurocentra have been lost entirely , with the intercentra enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae . This weaker type of backbone indicates the stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water . "

In 1862 , the Union Navy began to build a fleet of ironclads , which were used to break the Confederate blockade of the southern ports .
The most famous of these was the USS Monitor , which fought the CSS Virginia (formerly the Merrimack) in the Battle of Hampton Roads on March 9, 1862 .

In the 1820s and 1830s , warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18- and 24 @-@ pounder guns with 32 @-@ pounders on sailing ships @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and introducing 68 @-@ pounders on steamers . Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French Général Henri @-@ Joseph Paixhans , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sinop , spelled the end of the wooden @-@ hulled warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot , which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power . "

Convection around the","center increased in coverage and organization, and a small eye was observed by satellite imagery. The system continued to move westward at about 10 mph (16 km/h), and the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Karen at 2100 UTC that day.
Karen's forward motion slowed as it approached the Yucatán Peninsula, and the storm turned northwestward on September 8 . A reconnaissance aircraft reported maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) at 1800 UTC, which prompt","system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas .

 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . W,"are was successful in acquiring a site at Hoddesdon, and the first burial took place there on 15th June 1874.
 The first burials were made in the new cemetery at Hoddesdon in 1874.
 In 1902 the Parish Council of Ware agreed to purchase the freehold of the cemetery from the trustees of the parish church.
 The cemetery is still owned by the Parish Council of Ware.","are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in perpetuity , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government . "
" Her 1923 annual performance at Aeolian Hall entitled "" Recital of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice "" became a","sensation.
In the early 1920s, she was one of the first singers to record with electrical equipment. She recorded in New York City on February 14, 1925, with Victor Records. The recording session took place at the Columbia Phonograph Company's studio at 799 Seventh Avenue, New York City.
She also appeared in several silent films, including The Song of Love (1923), The White Rose (1923) and The Man Who Laughs (1928).
In 192","historic occasion when she presented the works of George Gershwin , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert . The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time . She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold Schoenberg , Darius Milhaud , Béla Bartók , and Paul Hindemith . The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . She opened with Alexander 's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin , then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin : I 'll Build a Stairway to Paradise , Innocent Ingénue Baby , and Swanee . Gershwin played the piano for these pieces . Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann @-@ Heink , Virgil Thomson , and Paul Whiteman . Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art .

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ulls upwards.
The skull of _Panderichthys_ is very similar to that of the earliest known tetrapod, _Tiktaalik_. The two animals are both about 30 cm long and have a similar number of bones in their skulls. However, _Tiktaalik_ has a much more complex jaw than _Panderichthys_. This suggests that the early tetrapods had already evolved a more advanced way of catching food.
#  **Fishy features**
The first tetrapods were not just","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF,"'s capabilities.
The Defence White Paper 2000, released on 30 November 1999, set out a new strategic direction for Australia's defence force. It was the first Defence White Paper since 1987 and the first to be published under the Howard Government.
The White Paper stated that 'the principal task of the Australian Defence Force is to defend Australia and its national interests'. This statement reflected the fact that Australia had moved from being a regional power to one with global responsibilities.
The White Paper also recognised that the A","'s ability to conduct operations outside Australia .

" During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and","the Soviet Union, Australia would be defended by the United States. The US was expected to provide air cover for Australia's cities and towns, and to protect its sea communications with Britain and New Zealand.
The first major review of Australia's defence policy since World War II was conducted in 1946–47 under the chairmanship of Sir Richard Kirby. It concluded that Australia should develop an independent capability to defend itself against external attack, but that this could not be achieved without assistance from the United States. In the meantime, however, it recommended that Australia should continue to rely on the","Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and RAN . "
" Beginning in January 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying the Tetrarchs and their crews inside Hamilcar","gliders. The first of these was a test to see if the Tetrarch could be carried by the Hamilcar, which had been designed for the American-built Stinson L-5 Sentinel light observation aircraft. The tests proved that the Tetrarch could be transported by the Hamilcar, but it was found that the Tetrarch's nose wheel would not retract when the aircraft landed on its belly. This meant that the Tetrarch would have to be dismantled before being loaded into the Hamilcar.

" There are nine Twin @-@ Pyramid Complexes at Tikal , one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and","reassembled elsewhere.
The pyramids were built by the Maya, who lived in what is now Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico. The Maya civilization flourished from about 2000 BC to AD 900. It was a highly developed culture that had its own writing system, calendar, mathematics, astronomy, and art.
The Maya built their cities on top of earlier settlements. They used stone, brick, and mortar for building materials. The buildings were usually made of wood, but some were made of stone","some others were partly destroyed . They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east – west axis . These pyramids are flat @-@ topped and have stairways on all four sides . A row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids , and lying roughly equidistant from them , there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair . On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine doorways . The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20 @-@ year ( or k 'atun ) intervals during the Late Classic . The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza . It was once thought that these complexes were unique to Tikal but rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as Yaxha and Ixlu , and they may reflect the extent of Tikal 's political dominance in the Late Classic .

" As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the","carbonyl group by an intramolecular reaction.
 The first step is to convert the aldehyde into a ketone, which can be done with sodium methoxide or potassium tert-butoxide.
The second step is to add a Grignard reagent to the ketone, and then hydrolyze the resulting alkyl magnesium bromide.
The third step is to treat the resulting alcohol with a strong base such as lithium diisopropyl amide.
The fourth step is to deprotonate the resulting","pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation . In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with α @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain . Coordination of an electron donating α @-@ substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation . "
 Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America . Sent there to arrange a,"concert tour, he was also charged with finding a suitable pianist for the occasion. He chose the young American composer and pianist Virgil Thomson (b. 1896), who had been studying in Paris since 1919. The two men became close friends, and Gauthier introduced Thomson to many French composers, including Darius Milhaud, Arthur Honegger, and Francis Poulenc.
Gauthier's own music is not well known today, but it was highly regarded by his contemporaries. His first major work, _Le Chant de la clo","tour of North America by Maurice Ravel , she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him , but also with Erik Satie and Les six . This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert .

" Throughout the season , sea surface temperatures within the western equatorial Pacific were above normal , including those in the South China Sea . Areas of","warm water, known as El Niño pools, developed in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. The strengthening of these pools was associated with a weakening of the trade winds that normally blow from east to west across the Pacific Ocean.
The development of El Niño conditions is an important factor in determining the weather patterns over Australia during winter. In particular, it can influence rainfall in southern Australia.
In December 2015, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) issued its first El Niño warning for the 2015–16 season.

It had been annexed by the British in 1886 and became part of Burma. In 1942, when the Japanese invaded Burma, they took over the area and established a puppet state called the Mengzi Government.
The Chinese were not happy with this arrangement. They wanted to take back their land. So, in 1943, they launched a major offensive against the Japanese.

" The post quartermaster , Captain Thomas Swords , was in charge of building Fort Scott 's structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction",". He also had to deal with the Indians who were constantly trying to steal horses from the fort.
The first problem that Captain Swords faced was the lack of supplies. The soldiers at Fort Scott needed food, clothing, and other necessities. They could not get these things because they were too far away from civilization. The nearest town was St. Louis, Missouri, which was about 100 miles away. This meant that the soldiers had to travel by horseback or on foot to get their supplies.
Another problem that Captain Swords faced was the constant threat of Indian attacks. The Indians did not","on the Kansas prairie , which had few trees .

It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weathering , making analysis difficult . It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion . Straps descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument . The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps ; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region . Although most of the facial detail is lost , the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident , a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads . "
 Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to,"remove large chunks of stone, then smoothed with abrasives such as sand and pumice. The heads were then carved into their final form by removing smaller pieces of stone from the surface using a variety of tools including hammerstones, bone or wooden wedges, and adzes.
The heads are thought to have been made in two stages. First, the head was roughed out using a hammerstone and anvil. Then, the face was refined using a polishing tool. This is evident in the distinctive ""polish lines"" on the faces of the heads. These lines are","chip away both large and small flakes of stone . The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones , which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case .

The exterior shots were filmed at a real house located at 304 North Elm Drive in Beverly Hills, California .
The interior scenes were shot at the Warner Brothers Studio in Burbank, California .","The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between Ricky and Jane 's bedroom windows , and between Ricky 's bedroom and Lester 's garage . The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. Fitts — watching from Ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex . Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the backlot , on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed . The inside of the Burnhams ' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the Fitts ' home was shot in the city 's Hancock Park neighborhood . Ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his "" monkish "" personality , while at the same time blending with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side . The production deliberately minimized the use of red , as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere . The Burnhams ' home uses cool blues , while the Fitts ' is kept in a "" depressed military palette "" . "
" Rhodesia then attacked ZIPRA 's bases in Zambia , in what Group Captain Peter Petter @-@ Bowyer later described","as ""a very nasty little war"".
 The Rhodesian government was also concerned about the possibility of a Soviet invasion, and had been working on plans to defend against such an eventuality.
 In 1976, the British government announced that it would be sending troops to Rhodesia to help train the army there.
The Rhodesian Army was trained by the British Army's 22nd Special Air Service (SAS) Regiment, which was based at Hereford .
In 1978, the Rhodesian Army was renamed the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI","as "" payback time "" for Flight 825 . Operation Gatling , launched on 19 October 1978 , was another joint @-@ force operation between the Air Force and the Army , which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers . Gatling 's primary target , just 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) north @-@ east of central Lusaka , was the formerly white @-@ owned Westlands Farm , which had been transformed into ZIPRA 's main headquarters and training base under the name "" Freedom Camp "" . ZIPRA presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka . About 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp , with senior ZIPRA staff also on site . The Rhodesian operation 's other targets were Chikumbi , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of Lusaka , and Mkushi Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia . Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked . "
 Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following,"a series of disasters, including the loss of their entire fleet in the Dardanelles, they were forced to withdraw.
The campaign was a failure for the Allies but it did have one positive outcome: it gave the Ottomans a taste of modern warfare and they were never again able to defeat the Allied forces on land.
#  **British naval blockade**
In order to prevent supplies reaching the Turks, the British imposed a naval blockade around the coast of the Black Sea. The Russians also imposed a blockade on the Bosporus Straits which","a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British , Indian and French forces committed to the campaign . The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) — commanded by British general William Birdwood — subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915 . Although promising to transform the war if successful , the Gallipoli Campaign was ill @-@ conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives .

" Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge",".
 The artist's wife, Alice, was the model for the figure on the right.
 In this painting, Bacon used a photograph by John Deakin as a source.
 Bacon's friend Lucian Freud painted this portrait of him in 1952.
 Bacon's first major exhibition took place at the Hanover Gallery in London in 1949.
 Bacon's paintings were exhibited alongside those of Francis Picabia, Marcel Duchamp, and Jackson Pollock at the Galerie Maeght in Paris in 1949.
 Ba",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas "" in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . "" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . "" This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","himself in charge of the British Red Cross Society's work in France. He was appalled by the conditions in which wounded soldiers were being treated, and he decided to do something about it.
Ware had been impressed by the work of Dr. Emily Murphy, who had set up a hospital for Canadian troops at Valcartier, Quebec, in 1914. She had also established a system of visiting nurses to care for the sick and wounded in their homes. Ware asked her to help him establish a similar service in England.
In 1915, Ware and","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission . The new Graves Registration Commission had over 31 @,@ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50 @,@ 000 registered by May 1916 . "
" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","internal fertilization, but some may have been ovoviviparous.
Temnospondyls were the first group of tetrapods to evolve a skull with a bony palate and a hyoid arch (a cartilaginous structure that supports the tongue). The hyoid arch is present in all living amphibians and reptiles, but it was lost in the ancestors of mammals.
The earliest known temnospondyls are from the Early Carboniferous period (about 320 million years ago) of Europe and North America. They had","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
