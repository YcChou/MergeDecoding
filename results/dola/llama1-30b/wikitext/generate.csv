 The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a,"field near Ranville, Normandy.
The first Allied soldiers to land in France on D-Day were British airborne troops. Their mission was to secure the left flank of the beaches where the main Allied invasion force would land later that morning.
The paratroopers were dropped from C-47 transport planes at 00:50 hours. They had been briefed for their mission just two days before.
Their objective was to capture intact two bridges over the Orne River and Caen Canal, destroy five bridges over the Dives River to the east,","landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The Tetrarchs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "

The Church of Scientology is an organization founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in 1954, and claims to have millions of members around the world.
Scientologists believe that humans are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Its practices include counseling sessions known as auditing that cost anywhere from $800 to tens of thousands of dollars.
In Germany, the church is under observation by domestic intelligence agencies in some states because of concerns about its alleged cult-like practices and suspected violations of human rights.

The first Tetrarchs were delivered in late 1942 and saw action in North Africa, where they performed well. However, the Tetrarch's light armour made it vulnerable to anti-tank guns and artillery fire, and its open top meant that the crew were exposed to small arms fire.

" In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Copán , whose founder K 'inich Yax K 'uk","' Mo' was a vassal of Tikal.
The Classic period saw the height of Maya civilization, and their greatest building projects were undertaken during this time. The city of Tikal in Guatemala exemplifies this apogee of Maya culture; its Great Plaza has been likened to a cathedral, with Temple I towering over the North side of the plaza and Temple II on the South.
The Maya are known for the only fully developed written language of the pre-Columbian Americas, as well as for their art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and","' Mo ' was clearly connected with Tikal . Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal . K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Copán in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan . Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as "" Lord of the West "" , much like Siyah K ’ ak ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries . "

 The disintegration of the Pagan Empire was now complete . But the Mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created . They,"were content to rule as a loose confederation of tribes, and to leave the administration of their empire to local rulers.
The Mongol Empire was divided into four khanates: the Ilkhanate (Iran), the Chagatai Khanate (Central Asia), the Golden Horde (Russia) and the Yuan Dynasty (China).
The Ilkhanate was founded by Hulegu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, who conquered Iran in 1256. He made his capital at Maragha, near Lake Urmia","would send no more expeditions to restore order .

" Temnospondyls ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . In living tetrapods , the main body of the vertebra is","formed by a cylindrical bone called the centrum. The neural arch, which protects the spinal cord, and the haemal arch, which supports the ribs, are both derived from the neural arch.
The intercentrum is a small bone that articulates with the centrum in front and behind. It is present in all temnospondyls except for the dvinosaurs and some dissorophoids.
The pleurocentrum is a bone that articulates with the intercentrum in front and the parapophysis behind. It is present in most","a single piece of bone called the centrum , but in temnospondyls , this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum . Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls : stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae . In rhachitomous vertebrae , the intercentra are large and wedge @-@ shaped , and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them . Both elements support a spine @-@ like neural arch , and well @-@ developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae .

In stereospondylous vertebrae , the pleurocentra have been lost entirely , with the intercentra enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae . This weaker type of backbone indicates the stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water . "

 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . W,"are was a small town and the population was growing. The first cemetery opened in 1856, the second in 1872 and the third in 1903.
The cemetery is divided into two sections by a road which runs from north to south. The older section is on the west side of this road and contains the original chapel. The newer section is on the east side of the road and has a modern crematorium.

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ulls, and then closed them again.
The head of the turtle is a complex structure that has evolved to allow for a wide range of movements. The skull consists of the cranium (braincase) and the mandible (jaw). The cranium is made up of several bones, including the frontal, parietal, squamosal, and supraoccipital. The mandible is composed of the dentary, splenial, angular, surangular, articular, and prearticular. The hyoid apparatus, which supports the tongue, is located","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF,"'s capabilities.
The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has been involved in a number of operations overseas since the end of the Cold War, but none have had as great an impact on its future direction as the deployment to East Timor in 1999.

" As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the","C–C bond between the carbonyl carbon and the β-carbon of the enone.
The Nazarov cyclization is an organic reaction, named after Alexander Nazarov, that converts an enamine to a tetrasubstituted allene. The reaction proceeds via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.
Nazarov cyclizations have been used in the synthesis of natural products such as (−)-griffonilide, (+)-griffonilide, (+)-griffonidine, and (−)-gr","pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation .

The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. Fitts — watching from Ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex . Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the backlot , on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed .

" Rhodesia then attacked ZIPRA 's bases in Zambia , in what Group Captain Peter Petter @-@ Bowyer later described","as ""a wholly illegal act of aggression"".
The Rhodesian Air Force (RhAF) was the air arm of the Rhodesian Security Forces during the period 1965 to 1979, and of the armed forces of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 1981. The RhAF was formed on 1 April 1964 by renaming the Federal Air Force of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland . It was disbanded on 31 December 1979, when it was replaced by the Air","as "" payback time "" for Flight 825 .

ZIPRA presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka . About 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp , with senior ZIPRA staff also on site . The Rhodesian operation 's other targets were Chikumbi , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of Lusaka , and Mkushi Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia . Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked . "
 Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following,"a naval bombardment on 25 April 1915, troops from Australia and New Zealand landed at Anzac Cove. The Turks were ready for them and the Allies suffered heavy casualties.
The British government was determined to break through the Turkish lines and in August 1915 sent in more troops. In September the French joined the campaign and by November there were 100,000 men ashore. But the Turks had also been reinforced and the fighting continued into 1916.

" Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge",". He was, however, always aware of the need to create a sense of unity in each painting, and this is achieved by the use of colour, line and form.
 The artist's studio was a place where he could experiment with new ideas and techniques. In the early 1950s Bacon began to paint on unprimed canvases, which allowed him to apply the oil paint more thickly. This gave his images a greater sense of physicality, and also enabled him to achieve a richer range of colours.
 Bacon's paintings are characterised by their expressive distort",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas "" in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . "" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . "" This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","himself in France. He was appalled by the suffering he witnessed and determined to do something about it.
Ware's idea was to record the names of those who died, so that their sacrifice would not be forgotten. In 1915, he set up the Graves Registration Commission (GRC) with the support of Sir Douglas Haig , commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force . The GRC became the Imperial War Graves Commission in 1917 and, at the end of the war, was given the task of marking and maintaining the gra","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission . The new Graves Registration Commission had over 31 @,@ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50 @,@ 000 registered by May 1916 . "
" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","external fertilization, with the male and female coming together to release sperm and eggs into the water. In some species, however, the males may have had a copulatory organ that was used to transfer sperm directly to the female's cloaca.
Temnospondyls were the dominant tetrapods of their time, and they are found on every continent except Antarctica. The first temnospondyls appeared in the Early Carboniferous period, about 340 million years ago, and the last died out at the end of the Cretaceous period, about 6","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
