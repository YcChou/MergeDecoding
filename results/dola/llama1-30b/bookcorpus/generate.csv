I think the main thing is that you have to be honest with yourself, and if you are, then you will know whether or not you should stay in the relationship.
If you do decide to leave, then I would suggest doing so as amicably as possible. You don't want to burn any bridges, because you never know when you might need them again.

I'm not sure what the point of this is, but I'll bite.
The FBI has a list of 1000 people they consider domestic terrorists. The list includes people who have committed crimes in the past, or are suspected of planning to commit crimes in the future.
It also includes people who have done nothing wrong, but are on the list because they are members of groups that the FBI considers dangerous.
If you are a member of one of these groups, then you are probably on the list.

If you are seeing it in a dream, then I would say that this is a message from your subconscious mind. It is trying to tell you something about yourself, or about someone close to you.

He",and tried to take my leave .he stopped me once again .if you dont know where you are from how do you know where you have to go ?i think ill figure it out .we always think we will .he said as if to a person across the room .i turned but nobody was there .you have been very hospitable but i think i really should take my leave .not until i tell you my story .
at the halfway point i looked up .the door was so close .i had a feeling that if i ran to it i would be able to make,"it.
but then i saw the man in the black suit standing there waiting for me.
he was holding a gun and smiling.",it before anything bad happened .but i couldnt .i chose to take it slow and be vigilant .i moved my right foot carefully and touched down a few inches in front of my left .i then moved my left a little ahead of my right .i attempted to then lift the right but it wouldnt come .i pulled and pulled but i was stuck .to my horror my feet were sinking into the stone floor .
"his secretary , whose name he had never bothered to learn , jerked to a halt .your majesty , good morning , the man said ,","bowing low .
the king looked at him with distaste .he was a small man , with a thin face and a nervous manner .his clothes were shabby and ill-fitting .
i have no time for this nonsense , the king snapped .what do you want ?
the man swallowed hard .a messenger has arrived from the city of borg , your majesty , he said .
the king frowned .borg ? what is it that they want now ?
the man hesitated .it is not the people of borg who have sent the message , your maj","bowing so low that he almost hit his head on the step before him .edon barely slowed to nod at the man , who scurried after him , clutching at a leather folder .the greater council has sent a report about the , er , readiness of your army .it seems the man droned on while edon made his way to the royal dining room , a private chamber meant for meals with his family .no one else was present , and edon did not feel like sending for them .he ate luncheon alone , save for the secretary , who continued babbling about edons schedule , and alice , who sat in a chair by the door , smiling unchastely at edon .the greater council met that afternoon .edon sat in attendance .in some strange way , watching the dukes from the vantage of the throne appealed to him in a way that the council meetings never had as a prince ."
"mama !hush .you , she said , addressing liam .are you what you said you are , to those men ?yes , though","i am not a wizard , as they call it .i have the power of the earth and sky , and can use them for good or evil .
I'm going to be honest, I don't know if I'll ever get over this.","i wish we werent .it might have saved me a beating .were going to take a room at the inn , katin said .do you know the way ?the woman shook her head .the inns burned ."
it was dark ; the only light came from the hallway behind me .there was a television attached to the wall on my right and a white board below,"it .
I was in a hospital , I had been there for 3 days now .
I was lying on a bed with an IV drip attached to my left hand .
I looked around me .
The room was empty .
I tried to move but I couldn’t .
I felt like I was paralyzed .
I tried to scream but no sound came out of my mouth .
I was terrified .
I closed my eyes and tried to sleep .
I woke up to the sound of someone knocking on the door .
“Come in ” I said .","it .the opposite wall had a lot of openings where things could be plugged in .a chair faced a large window .it was night and nothing could be seen .there was a person sitting in the chair , facing the window .they sat completely still .i went up to the back of the chair .i could feel a sadness emanating from somewhere .are you alright ?"
"katin felt jealousy grasping at her , but she made herself turn away and go out into the cold night .the town seemed not half so","bright as it had before, and the people in the streets looked more like shadows than real men and women.
katin was a little girl who lived with her mother in a small house on the edge of a forest.her father had died when katina was very young,and since then her mother had worked hard to support them both.
one day,when katina was about seven years old,she went for a walk in the forest with her friend anna.they were playing hide-and-seek,and katina hid behind a tree.suddenly she heard footsteps coming towards her.a","friendly on this trip .shadows lurked , watching her .she encountered no one except a pair of drunken men who whistled at her as she went .she bulled onward , ignoring them .she must have taken a wrong turn , because the street she found herself on didnt look quite familiar .but then there was the square ahead , a torch glowing at each end of the caravan as usual .she must have come at it from another angle .woozy , she stopped in the doorway of an apothecary , powders and potions on display in the window .her head spun with drink and anger ."
"amira asked .she really had no idea what the woman thought .the bear attack must have been terrifying to mari , but like her boys shed","done what she needed to do to survive.
""I'll be fine, I just need a little time to get used to it."" She said with a smile. ""And you're right, I did do what I had to, and I'm glad that I was able to help my sons in the process. I've never felt so strong before.""
She looked at Amira for a moment, then back at the fire. ""You know, I think I'd like to go on an adventure of my own one day. I've always wanted to see the world, but I'",recovered quickly .mari shook her head .you seem honest .i dont see bad in you .what does your husband say ?amira shrugged .he wants me to keep it a secret .but after what happened out there it wouldnt have been fair to keep it from you .
"dardan asked .he bulled aside a city guardsman and leaned against the wall .the guardsman opened his mouth to object ,","but then he saw who it was .and closed it again.
""I'll be back in a minute, "" Dardan said. He walked over to the door of the room and knocked on it.
""Who is it?"" came a voice from inside.
""Dardan,"" he replied. ""Open up.""
The door opened and Dardan stepped inside. The man who had been standing there turned around and looked at him.
""What do you want?"" he asked.
""I need your help,"" Dardan said. ""I have a job for you.""
""A","then thought better of confronting two agitated nobles .it must be , she said .there are mages out there , at least .a lot of them .it was hard to count the flashes of silver light , but shed seen at least a dozen so far .liam and katin came up just then , and a few moments later razh and patric followed .count razh gazed out at the soldiers .by the caretaker !"
"it just pisses people off .you shit-eating son of a bitch .rage , rage , rage .the human is angry",".
I've been thinking about the ""rage"" thing. I think that there are two kinds of rage: 1) the kind that comes from being hurt, and 2) the kind that comes from feeling powerless. The first kind of rage is what we see in abused children, who lash out at others because they have been hurt by others. The second kind of rage is what we see in bullies, who lash out at others because they feel powerless to control their own lives.
The first kind of rage can be healed with love, but the second kind of","and i am fascinated .slowly , i begin to separate myself from the mans shadow .the other weres in the cells around us press themselves close to watch the scene unfold .yipping in excitement as i continue to grow behind the human .stretching higher and higher .i am the tower of babel and the human nothing more than rubble .still talking , but unable to hear ."
"and technically ?technically , im what youd call a hell hound .which is a werewolf .only , evolved .like a","vampire .

"he never looked to see if we were behind him , he simply assumed that we were .the arrogance of him , the sheer ego ,","it was breathtaking .
I'm not sure what you mean by ""behind"" him. He was a few steps ahead of us, but I don't think he was looking back at all.
He was walking in front of us and we were following him .
I've been thinking about this for a while and I'm still not sure what you mean.
We were walking in the same direction as he was, but he was a few steps ahead of us. We weren't following him, we were just going the same way.
I'm sorry, I'm","was almost palatable .i felt as if i were a lesser mortal tramping in the wake of a king , and the only thing that made that particular pill easy to swallow was that marcus clearly noticed it too .the only difference was that marcus , for all his bluster earlier , seemed more used to following than leading .not as interesting as everything else that id gathered today , but still worth noting for future reference .speaking of which , i loved how id been here less than an hour and i was already drowning in dirt .the only problem was that none of what i would see today would be caught on camera .i was supposed to be setting up the hidden cameras and microphones today and scoping out other employees to see who would be the most likely to blabber about evans .all of this was prime material , but i wouldnt be able to use any of it without some proof to back it up .otherwise it would all be my word against theirs ."
the people there might have an idea as to where i could find my deepest desire .a couple guards marched back and forth outside the largest tent,".
""i'm looking for a man named khufu,he is the pharaoh of egypt.""
the guard looked at me with a puzzled look on his face.
""you are in the wrong place,sir.this is not egypt.we are in mesopotamia.and we do not have a king here.we have a queen.her name is hatshepsut.""
""well,where can i find this khufu?""
""i don't know,sir.but you should go to the temple of amun-ra",.i asked for admittance and they let me inside .it was filled with cots while lanterns hung from the ceiling .a group huddled in the corner .they surrounded a large man with a crown .i went right up to him .hello sir .i said pleasantly .who are you ?
