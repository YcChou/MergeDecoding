" However , the remnant low associated with Josephine began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 . Convection around the","center of circulation became more concentrated, and the circulation became better defined. As a result, the National Hurricane Center declared that Josephine had regenerated into a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on September 7, while it was located about 1,000 mi (1,600 km) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California.
Josephine continued to intensify as it moved west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph (15 to 25 km/h). By September 8","system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas . However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . "
 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . W,"are Cemetery was opened in 1858 and the first burials took place in 1859. The cemetery was consecrated by the Bishop of Rochester in 1862. The cemetery was extended in 1884 and again in 1892. The cemetery was closed to new burials in 1965.
The cemetery is laid out in a grid pattern with paths running north-south and east-west. The layout of the cemetery is similar to that of Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington.","are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in perpetuity , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government . "

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ulls upward and outward .
Stereospondyls are a clade of temnospondyl amphibians that lived from the Early Triassic to the Early Cretaceous. They are distinguished from other temnospondyls by the structure of their skulls, which are flattened from top to bottom and side to side. The name ""stereospondyl"" means ""solid vertebrae"" and refers to the fact that the vertebrae of stereospondyls are not hollowed out as they are in other temnospondyls.","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

" During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and","the Soviet bloc, Australia would be the target of a Soviet nuclear attack.

It was succeeded by the Air Force of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in","as "" payback time "" for Flight 825 . Operation Gatling , launched on 19 October 1978 , was another joint @-@ force operation between the Air Force and the Army , which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers . Gatling 's primary target , just 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) north @-@ east of central Lusaka , was the formerly white @-@ owned Westlands Farm , which had been transformed into ZIPRA 's main headquarters and training base under the name "" Freedom Camp "" . ZIPRA presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka . About 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp , with senior ZIPRA staff also on site . The Rhodesian operation 's other targets were Chikumbi , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of Lusaka , and Mkushi Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia . Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked . "
 Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following,the failure of the August offensive at Suvla Bay and Anzac Cove the decision was taken to evacuate the peninsula. In 1916 the Gallipoli peninsula was evacuated by the Allied forces. The evacuation was carried out between the 19th and 20th December 1915 and was one of the greatest achievements of its kind during the First World War. The evacuation was carried out without a single Allied casualty. The Turks realised that the Allies were evacuating the peninsula,"a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British , Indian and French forces committed to the campaign . The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) — commanded by British general William Birdwood — subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915 . Although promising to transform the war if successful , the Gallipoli Campaign was ill @-@ conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives . Australian casualties totalled 26 @,@ 111 , including 8 @,@ 141 killed . "
" Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge",".  He said, ""I want a very ordered image, but I want it to come about quite accidentally, for me to arrive at it, not to contrive it. I don't like paintings that are planned. I like paintings to emerge from the painting process, rather than be imposed upon it.""
Bacon's abstracted figures are typically isolated in geometrical cage-like spaces, set against flat, nondescript backgrounds. Bacon said that he saw images ""in series"", and his work typically focused on a single subject for sustained periods, often in tripty",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas "" in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . "" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . "" This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","himself in charge of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross in France. In 1915, he was asked by the War Office to set up a Graves Registration Commission (GRC) for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. The GRC's brief was to ensure the proper burial of the dead, maintain records of where they were buried and, when requested, to try to identify bodies for the information of the next of kin.
In 1915, Fabian Ware was asked by the War Office to set up a Graves Registration","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission . The new Graves Registration Commission had over 31 @,@ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50 @,@ 000 registered by May 1916 . "
" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","external fertilization, in which the eggs and sperm are released into the water and fertilization takes place outside of the female's body. However, some temnospondyls may have reproduced through internal fertilization, in which the eggs are fertilized inside the female's body. Internal fertilization may have evolved independently in temnospondyls and other amphibians, or it may have evolved once in the common ancestor of all living amphibians.","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
