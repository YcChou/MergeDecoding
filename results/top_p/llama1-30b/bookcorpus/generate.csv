Dardan was surprised by the explosions , he had no idea where they were coming from , but he was sure they were coming from the city .

[","imsee * once upon a time , a handmaiden to the queen of chaveneigh was ill-treated , and she gave birth to a little girl in the wild forest beyond .though she could not help loving the beautiful , blue-eyed girl , she was not allowed her own children in the palace , and so she left the child within a fairy ring , hoping that the mischievous but kind-hearted sprites would take pity on them both .the magic of fairy rings is this : theyre circles of particularly pretty magical mushrooms wherein nothing else may grow .on any given night a flock of fairies , imps , and elves might choose to stage one of their wild parties there deep into the night .the spirits of the forest protect their magical places with great jealousy , however , so the fairy rings are guarded by ferocious toads the size of small deer .the newborn girl , who cried loudly through her first painful , lonely minutes in this new world , was no sooner abandoned by her mother than she was set upon by just such a giant toad .his name was pup-hem-tup , and he croaked at her in displeasure .his eyes bulged as he raised a webbed foot to cover the babes screaming mouth .the little girls fist , thrown about in a tantrum , hit upon the toads bumpy , amphibious skin , and her small fingers closed around him .feeling the warmth of her tiny infant hand , pup-hem-tup let out a plaintive ribbit and lowered himself beside the now-silent little girl , keeping her warm until the fairies arrived at sundown ."

katin looked up at the sky and saw that the moon was shining brightly , and the stars were twinkling .
katin began to walk slowly along the street , and soon she came to the river . it was very wide , and the water looked black in the moonlight .
katin sat down on the bank and looked at the water . it was very still , and she could see her face reflected in it .

""well you've come to the right place"" the voice said.
i opened the flap and stepped inside.

""i'm looking for my deepest desire"" i said.
