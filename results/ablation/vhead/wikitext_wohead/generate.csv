The Tetrarchs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "

The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

The programme sought to address Scientology 's image problems in Germany , to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as Germany 's National Socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society , with a special emphasis on manoeuvring Scientologists into key positions in industry and government . As most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in . However , according to the BfV , the strategy has not had any significant success . By 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology .

Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
