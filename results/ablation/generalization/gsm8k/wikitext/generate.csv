 The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a,"heavy cross-fire from the German defenders. The gliders were unloaded and the men moved off to their assembly areas. The next day, the brigade was ordered to move to the area of the village of Ranville, where it was to be held in reserve. The brigade was to be ready to move to the beaches at 08 : 00 on 7 June. The brigade was to be held in reserve until the 8th, when it was to be ready to move to the beaches at 08 : 00. The brigade was to be held in reserve until","landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The Tetrarchs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "
" Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Mer","idian was incorporated in 1870, the town had a hotel.

" With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel",", the HMVS Cerberus , which was used to patrol the coastline and protect the colony from invasion. The Cerberus was replaced in 1863 by the HMVS Nelson , which was used to protect the colony from the threat of American Civil War blockade runners.
In 1860 , the Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, John Robertson, proposed the establishment of a permanent naval force for the protection of the Australian colonies. The proposal was rejected by the British government, which was concerned that the colonies would not be able to afford the cost of",", HMCSS Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First Taranaki War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas . The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad HMVS Cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats . New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats and a corvette . The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , HMCS Protector . Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery . Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action . The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia .

" Near the close of the 1904 session , legislators approved the creation of Beckham County from parts of Carter , Elliott , and","Roger Mills counties. The new county was named for William H. Beckham, a former governor of Oklahoma Territory.
The first county seat was located at the town of Elk City, which was also the county's largest town. In 1907, the county seat was moved to the town of Sayre, which was located in the center of the county.
Beckham County is located in the southwestern part of Oklahoma. It is bordered by the state of Texas to the southwest, by Cimarron County to the northwest, by Roger Mills County to the northeast","Lewis counties . Olive Hill was made the county seat .

" In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Copán , whose founder K 'inich Yax K 'uk","' Mo' was a descendant of the great king of Tikal, Jasaw Chan K'awiil. The city was founded in 378 and flourished until 822, when it was abandoned. The city was built on a hill overlooking the Copán River, which flows into the Motagua River. The city was surrounded by a wall with a moat, and the main buildings were located on the top of the hill. The city was divided into two parts: the residential area and the ceremonial area. The residential area was located on the north side of the hill,","' Mo ' was clearly connected with Tikal . Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal . K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Copán in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan . Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as "" Lord of the West "" , much like Siyah K ’ ak ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries . "

 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . W,"are was successful in acquiring land from the parishes of St. Mary, St. Peter and St. Paul, and St. John the Baptist. The first of these was the St. Mary's Cemetery, which was opened in 1854. The St. John the Baptist Cemetery was opened in 1856, and the St. Paul's Cemetery in 1857.
The St. Mary's Cemetery was located on the south side of the road between the present day St. Mary's Church and the old St. Mary's Church.","are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in perpetuity , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages .

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ulls upwards.
The skull of the stereospondyl _Panderichthys_ is very similar to that of the early tetrapod _Acanthostega_ , but the skull of _Acanthostega_ is much more elongated.

The skull of _Panderichthys_ is much more robust than that of _Acanthostega_.
The skull of _Panderichthys_ is much","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF,"'s capabilities. The deployment was a success, but it was also a costly one. The ADF's commitment to East Timor was a major factor in the decision to increase defence spending by 30 per cent over the next four years.
The deployment to East Timor was the first time that the ADF had been involved in a peacekeeping operation since the Vietnam War. The ADF's involvement in East Timor was a significant departure from the traditional role of the ADF as a combat force. The ADF's role in East Timor was to provide a secure environment for","'s ability to conduct operations outside Australia . This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF 's ability to mount and sustain such operations .

" As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the","carbonyl group from the C=C bond of the alkene.
The first step in the reaction is the formation of a carbonyl group from the C=C bond of the alkene. This is accomplished by the addition of a nucleophile to the double bond. The nucleophile can be an alkoxide, an amine, or a halide. The nucleophile is usually a halide, such as bromide or iodide. The nucleophile attacks the double bond and forms a carbonyl group. The carbonyl group is then protonated","pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation . In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with α @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain . Coordination of an electron donating α @-@ substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation . "

Scientology is a controversial religion founded in 1954 by American science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard.

They participated in the Battle of Cape Engaño in late 1944 , where they decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches .

 Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to,"remove large chunks of stone, then smoothed with abrasive tools. The heads were then carved into the final form using a variety of stone tools, including hammerstones, bone and antler tools, and polishing stones.
The heads were then painted with red pigment, which was made from hematite, a mineral found in the nearby Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains. The pigment was mixed with water and applied to the stone using a brush made from the hair of a jaguar or ocelot. The heads were then covered with a layer of plaster","chip away both large and small flakes of stone . The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones , which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses .

" The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner backlot 's "" Blondie Street "" for the Burnham and Fitts ' homes .","The Burnham home was built on the corner of Blondie Street and Sunset Boulevard, while the Fitts home was built on the corner of Blondie Street and Sunset Plaza Drive .

The Burnham home was built in 1926 by architects Paul Williams and A.E. Bye . The home was built for the Warner Bros. film The Jazz Singer (1927)","The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between Ricky and Jane 's bedroom windows , and between Ricky 's bedroom and Lester 's garage . The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col. Fitts — watching from Ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex . Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the backlot , on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed . The inside of the Burnhams ' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the Fitts ' home was shot in the city 's Hancock Park neighborhood .

 Bacon'",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms .

"" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . "" This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","himself in charge of the British Red Cross Society's work in France. He was appalled by the number of wounded soldiers who were dying in the field hospitals because of the lack of blood transfusions. He decided to set up a system of blood donation in Britain.
In 1917 , Ware founded the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) and began to recruit blood donors. The NBTS was a private company, but it was funded by the government and the British Red Cross Society. It was the first blood transfusion service in the world.","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission .

Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
