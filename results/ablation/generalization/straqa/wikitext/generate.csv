The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "

" With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel",", the paddle steamer HMVS Victoria , which was used to patrol the Victorian coastline and the Port Phillip Heads. The ship was later renamed HMVS Cerberus and was used as a training ship for the Royal Australian Navy until 1924.
In 1859 , the Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, John Robertson, proposed the establishment of a permanent naval force for the colony. The proposal was rejected by the New South Wales Legislative Council, but the following year the council passed a resolution to establish a naval force for the protection of the colony",", HMCSS Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First Taranaki War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas .

" In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Copán , whose founder K 'inich Yax K 'uk","' Mo' was a descendant of the rulers of Tikal. The city was founded in the year 226 of the Mayan Long Count, and was the capital of the Mayan kingdom of Copán for over 400 years.
The city was abandoned in the 9th century, and the cause of its decline is unknown. The city was rediscovered in 1839 by the American explorer John Lloyd Stephens, who was the first to describe the ruins of the city.
The city was occupied by the Spanish in 1576, and the","' Mo ' was clearly connected with Tikal . Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal . K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Copán in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan . Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as "" Lord of the West "" , much like Siyah K ’ ak ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries . "

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ulls upwards and forwards.
The skull of the stereospondyl _Panderichthys_ is very similar to that of the early tetrapod _Acanthostega_ , but the skull of _Acanthostega_ is much more elongated. The skull of _Panderichthys_ is also much more robust than that of _Acanthostega_.
The skull of the stereospondyl _Panderichthys_ is very similar to that of the early tetrapod _Acanthostega_","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

" As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the","carbonyl group from the C=C bond of the double bond.
The first step is the formation of the carbonyl group from the C=C bond of the double bond. This is accomplished by the addition of a nucleophile to the carbonyl carbon. The nucleophile is usually an alcohol or amine, but can be an acid or other electrophile. The nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon from the carbonyl carbon's side of the double bond. The nucleophile is usually an alcohol or amine, but can be an acid","pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation . In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with α @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain . Coordination of an electron donating α @-@ substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation . "

 La Venta Monument 3 stands 1 @.@ 98 metres ( 6 @.@ 5 ft ) high and measures 1 @,".@ 100 metres ( 6 @.@ 33 ft ) in diameter.
The La Venta Monument 3 is a large monolithic sculpture of a human head, located in the Mexican state of Tabasco. It is the third of a series of sculptures found at the site of La Venta, a pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Mexican state of Tabasco. The sculpture is made of a single block of limestone and is the largest known Olmec sculpture. It was carved around 1200 BC and is the oldest known",".@ 6 metres ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) wide by 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) deep ; it weighs 12 @.@ 8 tons . Monument 3 was located a few metres to the east of Monument 2 , but was moved to the Parque @-@ Museo La Venta in Villahermosa . Like the other La Venta heads , its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weathering , making analysis difficult . It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion . Straps descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument . The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps ; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region . Although most of the facial detail is lost , the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident , a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads . "
 Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to,"remove large chunks of stone, then smoothed with abrasives such as sandstone or coral. The heads were then carved with stone tools to remove the remaining stone and to give the final shape.
The heads were carved from basalt, a hard volcanic stone that is common in the region. Basalt is a very hard stone that is difficult to carve, and the Olmecs used a variety of techniques to carve the heads. The heads were carved using a variety of stone tools, including hammer stones, bone tools, and stone drills. The heads were also car","chip away both large and small flakes of stone . The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones , which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed . "

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","himself in the position of having to leave his job and join the army. He was sent to the Western Front as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was soon promoted to major. He was awarded the Military Cross for his work in the field.
In 1916 Ware was sent to the Italian Front, where he was appointed to the staff of the British Expeditionary Force in Italy. He was then sent to Salonika in Greece, where he was put in charge of the British Red Cross Hospital in the town of Kavala.
Ware was a man of great energy and initi","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission .

" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","internal fertilization , but some species may have been ovoviviparous .
The temnospondyls were the first group of amphibians to develop a skull with a bony palate and a secondary palate that separated the nasal and oral cavities. The secondary palate was formed by the fusion of the premaxillae and the maxillae. The secondary palate was a feature that was shared by the temnospondyls and the tetrapods .
The temnospondyls were the first group of amphibians to develop a skull with","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
