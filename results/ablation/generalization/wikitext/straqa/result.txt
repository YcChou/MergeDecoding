Q: Can Lamborghini's fastest model win a race against a Porsche 911?
A:

Answers: True

Model Answers: False

Model Completion: A Porsche 911's top speed is 211 km/h. A Lamborghini Aventador S can go from 0-100 km/h in 2.8 seconds. A Porsche 911 is much heavier than an Aventador S, and thus will have lower acceleration. A 211 km/h car with an acceleration of 112 km/h per second could still out-accelerate an Aventador S with an acceleration of 11 km/h per second. Thus, an Aventador S could still out-accelerate a 211 km/h car. So the answer is no.

Q: Would keelhauling be a fair punishment under the Eighth Amendment?
A:

Answers: False

Model Answers: False

Model Completion: Keelhauling was outlawed in 1852. It involves flogging an offender on both sides of the ship. In the US, this was often done with whipping on both sides of the ship, with the ship moving. However, whipping the offender while on both sides of the ship, without moving, was still allowed. The Eighth Amendment protects from "excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment". Flogging both sides of the ship while moving was both a form of whipping and moving, thus being both "excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment". However, whipping both sides of the ship without moving was not both an "excessive fine and cruel and unusual punishment". Thus, whipping both sides of the ship without moving was still allowed, and was thus not against the Eighth Amendment. Thus, the answer is no.

Q: Would a stool be useful for a Lusotitan to reach the top of an almond tree?
A:

Answers: False

Model Answers: False

Model Completion: A stool is an object with three or more legs that people use to sit on. A stool with three legs could support the Lusotitan. But the stool with three legs is about the same length as the Lusotitan, and thus, the stool with three legs is not much larger than the Lusotitan. A stool with three legs that is much larger than the Lusotitan could also be used. But such a large stool is much heavier than the Lusotitan and thus, the large stool is much heavier to move. A stool with two or fewer legs is lighter but much shorter. A stool with two or fewer legs that is much lighter and much shorter could not be used by the Lusotitan. A stool with three or fewer legs that is much lighter and much shorter could also be used. But such a light stool is much lighter, much shorter, and much thinner. It is much lighter, much shorter, and much thinner than the Lusotitan and thus, such a stool could be moved much easier and much faster.

Q: Does Evander Holyfield eat pork products?
A:

Answers: True

Model Answers: False

Model Completion: Evander Holyfield was once a heavy smoker. Smoking is known to damage lungs. Smokers often have COPD. Smoking is associated with increased risk of pneumonia. COPD and pneumonia can both cause people to stop eating. Evander Holyfield did stop eating during his battle against Riddick Bowe. Thus, there is some evidence that smoking could damage the lungs enough that he stopped eating. But this is not the same as him actually eating pork. Thus, there is some evidence that Evander Holyfield did stop eating during the battle, but there is no evidence that he did this due to COPD. Thus, there is some evidence, but no evidence, and thus, the answer is both yes and no.

Question: Making a "melted" table into long form using dplyr or reshape2 in R

I am trying to use dplyr and reshape2 in R to take the "melted" version of this dataframe and then put the values from each "value" into their own column in the long format.  For example, this is how the "melted" version of this table looks right now.  It is very similar to this [table](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pMxkq.jpg).  However, the value in the last column in this "melted" version is all in one column and not in 11 individual columns.  The final step in this process is to use this long form and put the values into 11 separate columns in this final form.  Thanks in advance.

Q: Is Sea World hazardous to leopard seal's health?
A:

Answers: True

Model Answers: False

Model Completion: A leopard seal is an Arctic mammal that eats fish. It is an endotherm. Endotherms have higher body temperature than their environment, thus, the water it is in will not be able to cool its body.
