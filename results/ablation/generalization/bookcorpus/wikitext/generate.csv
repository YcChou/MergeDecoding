 The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a,"down wind run from 5 to 35 feet with no ground support. They came in one at a time in line abreast over a frontage of about a mile. Each glider had two tows behind it to help control its course. They flew for about twenty-five minutes from their take off point to their landing place, which was between 22:25 and 22:55. They came in so quickly that there was not enough time to find out whether they had all landed in one place. One of the first things done on landing was to form up into two lines each","landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The Tetrarchs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "
" Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Mer","idian had been named and platted in 1862 , there was a hotel at the corner of what is now Fourth and Broadway.  In 1865, a year before the first post office opened , there were already two hotels on that same corner: the Grand Pacific and the Western .  By 1866 there was another hotel just up the block on what is now Fourth between Broadway and Market .  A hotel at Fourth and Market is recorded in 1866 .  In 1868 there was another hotel at what is now Fourth and Market","idian reached its "" Golden Age , "" several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century .

" With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel",", the paddle steamer Victoria.  Western Australia had no navy at all and relied on the Royal Navy for protection from attack from overseas.  Western Australia did however have its own small force of volunteers who formed part of the Western Australia Volunteer Naval Forces which was raised to counter a feared attack from the United States in 1862 .  Western Australia had its first warship built for it in the form of the iron hulled sloop HMS  Western Australia . Western Australia had two more iron-hulled sloop, the  Western Australia II and  Western Australia III",", HMCSS Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First Taranaki War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas . The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad HMVS Cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats . New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats and a corvette . The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , HMCS Protector . Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery . Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action . The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia .

" In 1986 , Churchill wrote an essay titled Pacifism as Pathology : Notes on an American Pseudopraxis critic","izing the movement for its refusal to use violence in response to threats against human life.  In it he said:  The first of these is that there are times when war is both just and necessary.  The second is that even in a state of just war there is no necessity for unrestricted, wanton or unnecessary violence.  The third is that all men should be taught to make distinctions between good and evil.  The fourth is that we must learn to control our emotions so that they do not overwhelm us with their power.  The fifth is that we should never tolerate","izing pacifist politics within the U.S. left as being hypocritical , de facto racist and ineffectual .

" Both the Provisional and Official IRA stepped up attacks after Bloody Sunday , with the tacit support of the residents . Local feelings changed","from one of sympathy to disgust as it was realised that the people who had lost their lives had done so in a pointless attack. In addition to this, there was no sense of outrage about the actions of the security forces in response. A bombing campaign against security force stations began on 26 February , which continued for over two weeks .

" Throughout January 17 the tropical storm would again oscillate in strength , resulting in a brief downgrade by the JTWC to tropical de","pression status at 23:00 UTC that same day. 24 hours later, however, it re-intensified back into a tropical storm as it started moving more east-southeast. 20 mph wind gusts and light showers were recorded on the southern part of Luzon while in the western Pacific a small ship encountered winds up to 65 mph.  26 hours later the system made landfall over the northeastern tip of the main island of Luzon with winds of 65 mph. 28 hours later it had exited","pression intensity .

" Earlier in the morning Dupont had proceeded with his column south and east along the river , from Marbach , according to instructions .

In this way he hoped to come up behind the enemy , who would then find it hard to get away . In addition , his men could rest for a while .

The French assault , heralded by cannon fire , caused Dokhturov 's troops to turn their attention from Gazan 's beleaguered force to face these new assailants . Although superior in numbers , Dokhturov 's column had no supporting artillery , and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size .

 Production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors . The War Office put their order on hold in a post @-@ Battle of France decision,"to use all available tanks for infantry support. In addition to this, there were many complaints from tank commanders that the suspension and road wheels of the tank were too soft to cope with the demands of off road warfare. A decision to improve these features led to delays in the tank being passed as serviceable for front line action. In addition to these complaints, it was realised that the turret needed to be made thicker to make it bullet resistant. In response to all of this, a decision was taken to re-engineer the suspension to improve its road going performance","to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle . Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks , light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour , were nevertheless deployed against them ; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re @-@ evaluate the suitability of the light tank design . The pre @-@ war role of the light tank , that of reconnaissance , meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @-@ country abilities .

" In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Copán , whose founder K 'inich Yax K 'uk","Mo', who came from a place in the east of the peninsula of Yucatán. At that time there was already an urban society on the peninsula with its own form of writing and its own political organization, which had to do with a state-chiefdom of some importance. In this sense it is important to point out that there are traces of urban life at least since 2622 bce in the so-called city of the first group at the site of the same name on the west bank of the lagoon of the same name in the state of Campeche. In addition to","' Mo ' was clearly connected with Tikal . Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal . K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Copán in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan . Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as "" Lord of the West "" , much like Siyah K ’ ak ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries . "

 A neutron spectrometer on board the Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to the northern and,southern lunar poles.

The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor , and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals , or that the impact site did not contain any ice .

" However , the remnant low associated with Josephine began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 . Convection around the","center had been noted in an image from the Himawari-8 weather satellite that same day and this convection would be more widespread as the day went on.   In addition to a small inner core of deep convection, there was now also some dry air at the surface over the southwest of the remnant low that could not be penetrated.   A cold front moving east across the state would help to support development but it would take another day for this to happen and so there would be only one day left in which any further development would be possible.  By early evening of the 8","system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas . However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . "
 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . W,"are agreed to purchase two small cemeteries from the owners of the nearby town of Littleport in 1862 and another at Hartest in 1865 . In 1863 he made a similar agreement with the owner of a field on the outskirts of Newmarket , which had already been used as a burial ground since at least 1662. By this time, however, there was little open ground within the confines of the town that could be acquired for use as a burial ground without first building houses upon it. A search therefore had to be made","are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in perpetuity , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages .

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ull roof up and down to form a large pouch that would then be stretched sideways.  In this way the head of these animals is similar to that of living frogs , which open their mouths in a similar way .  Some early amphibian reptiles had small teeth at the back of their jawbones that are characteristic of snapping turtles .   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "

 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF,"’s capabilities. In addition to a small but important presence in the Timor Sea, the ADF had to cope with the first large-scale use of its amphibious warfare assets since the Vietnam War. In this book, one of the foremost scholars on the history of the RAN discusses the planning for this deployment and its effect on the service and its people.

" During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and","the Soviet bloc , the United States would send to the aid of its allies all of its forces from both the Pacific and Atlantic .  In this way , it was thought , the US could use its overwhelmingly greater power in one of two separate fronts against its enemies.  By contrast , in the event of war with a country like the People’s Republic of China , which had only small armed forces but vast manpower , it would be possible for the United States to make limited use of its overwhelmingly greater power on land without being exposed to large-scale counter-offensives in","Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 .

One of these things is their positioning on a small plateau surrounded on all sides by low-lying jungle.  They all face east with their fronts open towards the sky.  In addition to being different than most of the other complexes they are also more similar to each other than any of the others are to one another.

" As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the","pyrone moiety as part of the cyclopentanone.  In addition to this, there is one more form of acyl anion which can be formed: that with two oxygens at the carbons next to each other.  In this form of acyl anion, there is no tautomeric form and it is only found in one conformation in which it is not possible for it to rearrange to another conformation.  In addition to these forms of acyl anions, there is one more form which is only present in one conformation which does not have","pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation . In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation .

In amphibians and reptiles, there is an opening on each side of the head into which jaw muscles can pass. In fishes and birds, this hole is absent. In all of these animals, however, there is a small hole behind each eye where a nerve passes out of the head. In early tetrapods, there was no hole here either. In place of this hole there is","bones in the skull , such as interfrontals , internasals , and interparietals , that have developed in some temnospondyl taxa .

" Scientology formulated a "" Clear Germany "" strategy in 1994 – similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries",".  In this regard, it is of importance that the Scientology movement had gained an important position of power and influence in the German state of Thuringia since the early 1980s.  Since then, it was possible for the movement to use its political power to make itself more accepted in society and to be granted public funds for its purposes.  In addition to these state grants, it is known that the movement had made large donations to political parties of all different political tendencies in the state of Thuringia in the late 1980s and early 1990s.","and regions of the world – with the long @-@ term aim of transforming German society in line with the Scientological ideal : a non @-@ pluralist society in which Scientology enjoys overriding influence . The programme sought to address Scientology 's image problems in Germany , to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as Germany 's National Socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society , with a special emphasis on manoeuvring Scientologists into key positions in industry and government . As most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in . However , according to the BfV , the strategy has not had any significant success . By 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology . According to Fifka & Sydora ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the "" Clear Germany "" programme is still being pursued . "

 In the early 1990s a group of newly observant members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue,"building. They wanted to form their own congregation and needed to be granted the use of a name, which is done in accordance with a longstanding policy that only one congregation should bear any name. In this case the request came from an already-established congregation and there was no way to know who would get to use the name if both asked for it. In addition to this conundrum there was another: what name? In this case there was only one other congregation in town that had ever been named for a place.

" The belligerents then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War , in which men lived in tunnels ,","dugouts and holes in the ground.  In addition to this, there was little co-operation between the allies as both wanted to control their own fronts and be seen to be fighting for their country.  In addition to this, there was the fact that both the Western allies and Russia had different methods of attacking their enemies.  In the west the Western allies would use bombardment from their heavy artillery to soften up their enemy before they went over the top with their infantry to try to take control of their front lines.  In contrast to this the Russians would send waves of","redoubts , and sandbagged forts behind barbed wire defences .

Monument 3 was located a few metres to the east of Monument 2 , but was moved to the Parque @-@ Museo La Venta in Villahermosa . Like the other La Venta heads , its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weathering , making analysis difficult . It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion . Straps descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument . The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps ; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region . Although most of the facial detail is lost , the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident , a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads . "
 Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to,"form a large lump.  They would then be heated in an oven to soften them and make them pliable.  A tool like a small adze was then used to smooth out the head to its final form.   A similar process is thought to have been used for other Olmec carvings.  A different approach to forming the head would be to use the coarser grained volcanic rock from which the face would be made.  In this case, a hand tool would be used to cut around the edges of a face that had already been formed.  A hole would be","chip away both large and small flakes of stone . The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones , which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed . "

In addition to these actions, the Rhodesian forces had to be on their guard for guerrilla infiltration from the south and east. They could not afford to take any chances: one slip up would lead to disaster. In this they had a formidable ally in their home ground of the low veldt of southern Zimbabwe .

 Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following,"on from their disaster in the Dardanelles they needed to learn how to do this. In early 1915 a small group of volunteers from the 2nd and 6th Regiments was formed for this task and these men would form the first ever amphibious infantry company to be raised in the British army. They would go on to take part in a series of training and testing operations that would help to refine and improve amphibious tactics for the whole of the army. The story of their work is one of great hardship, incredible skill and sheer guts","a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British , Indian and French forces committed to the campaign .

" Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge","from it. In one interview, he explained how this happened: 'When you make a beginning on a picture you never know quite where it is going to take you. Sometimes the first bit that you do will be a whole picture in itself. . . . If it happens to be a head it is finished. . . . Sometimes it is only the face that is done. . . . Sometimes it is only a hand that is there. . . . Sometimes it is just a little line that is all done. . . . Sometimes it is nothing at all but a patch of color that is done and then it is left for something",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas "" in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . "" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . "" This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .

In addition to his day job as a stockbroker and member of the board of directors for several mining and metal-manufacturing companies, he had just been named head of a small but important group that would be known as the Committee on the Recognition of the Distinction between the Civil and Military Dead. Its task was to come up with a way to make it clear who had died fighting in battle and who had not. In this way, they could then arrange for burials or cremations that would accord with each man's","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission .

" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","direct development . Some of these animals had large eggs that would be carried to ponds and other waterbodies.  In one group of temnospondyls , the dvinosaurids, there is some evidence for maternal brooding .  A small group of temnospondyls , the aistopoda , seem to have been the first tetrapods to use an amplexus form of reproduction .  They lived from the early to late Permian in what is now western and southern Russia .  They are not thought to be direct ancestors of later amphibians but their re","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
