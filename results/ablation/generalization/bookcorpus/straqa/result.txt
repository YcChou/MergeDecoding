Q: Does Ronda Rousey avoid BBQ restaraunts?
A:

Answers: True

Model Answers: False

Model Completion: Ronda Rousey is a vegetarian. A vegetarian will avoid eating meat. A meat restaurant that sells barbequed meats would have to be a meat restaraunt. So a restaraunt that is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt would be a restaraunt that is not a barbequed meats restaraunt. So a restaraunt that is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt would be a restaraunt that is a meat restaraunt but is not a barbequed meats restaraunt. Since a restaraunt would be a restaraunt if it is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt, then it is true that a restaraunt that is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt would be a restaraunt. Since it is true that a restaraunt would be a restaraunt if it is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt, then it is false that a restaraunt that is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt would be a restaraunt. Since it is false that a restaraunt would be a restaraunt if it is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt, then a restaraunt that is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt would be a restaraunt that would be a restaraunt if it is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt. Since a restaraunt would be a restaraunt if it is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt, then a restaraunt that is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt would be a restaraunt that would be a restaraunt if it is both a barbequed meats restaraunt and a meat restaraunt.

Q: Can whole genome sequencing be used for COVID-19?
A:

Answers: False

Model Completion: Whole genome sequencing is the process of mapping all of a living being's genes. Since this would require many hundreds of millions of dollars to do on a human being, this is unlikely to be done for any one human. Since we only know that there is one human with this specific mutation, this means that whole genome sequencing will not be done for anyone else who is infected with this same specific mutation. Since whole genome sequencing is unlikely to be done for anyone else who is infected with this same specific mutation, this means that whole genome sequencing is unlikely to be done for anyone else who is infected with this mutation.

Q: Can you watch the Borgia's World of Wonders before Ludacris's Release Therapy finishes?
A:

Answers: True

Model Answers: False

Model Completion: The Borgia's World of Wonders is about 2 hours long. Ludacris's Release Therapy is about 85 minutes long. So if the Borgia's World of Wonders begins at 6:30 and ends at 8:30, then it will have finished at about 8:30. If Ludacris's Release Therapy starts at about 8:30 and finishes at about 10:30, then it will have finished about 10:30. Since they do not both start at 6:30 and both end at about 10:30, then one must begin and one must finish later than the other. Since the Borgia's World of Wonders must be started first, it must be watched first. So the answer is no.

Q: Is hanging a viable execution method on a ship at sea?
A:

Answers: True

Model Answers: False

Model Completion: A ship at sea would have waves that would rock a person up and down. If someone is hung from their feet, this motion will make their head swing around. If they are hung from their arms, this motion will cause their head to fall forward. In either case, their head would hit something hard. If their head hit something hard enough to cause unconsciousness or death, then their heart would stop and they would drown in their own blood. If their head did not hit something hard enough to cause unconsciousness or death, then their head would get damaged. Since their head would be damaged if their head hit something hard, but would not die if their head did not hit something hard enough to cause unconsciousness or death, a ship at sea is not a good place to hang a person. So the answer is no.
