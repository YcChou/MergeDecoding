The capacity of Dorton Arena is 20,000. If we assume that each person passes through 30th Street Station once per day, then there are 7 million people passing through 30th Street Station every day. Since Dorton Arena holds 20,000 people, this means that if everyone passed through 30th Street Station every day, they would have to do so on average 35 days per year. This seems unlikely. Thus, the answer is no.

MODEL OUTPUT: 
A single barrel on a shotgun fires only one bullet per pull of the trigger. Double-barreled shotguns fire two bullets per pull of the trigger. Thus, a double-barreled shotgun will fire four times faster than a single barrel shotgun. Since squids have many brains, firing a double-barreled shotgun once should kill most of them. However, since squids regenerate their brains, even if you killed most of them with a double-barreled shotgun, they might still survive. So the answer is maybe.
