"On Monday, the Israeli army withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Palestinians rejoiced over this occasion, with Mahmoud Abb","as calling it a ""day of joy."" Israelis also celebrated this day as one that marked the end of an unnecessary war and the beginning of peace.
Yet, on Tuesday morning, I woke up to news that rockets had been launched into southern Israel by Hamas militants in Gaza. In fact, more than 100 rockets have been fired since then. The IDF has responded with attacks against targets in Gaza, killing at least three people so far.
Why is there still fighting after all these years? How can both sides celebrate this withdrawal while continuing to","as saying that ""This is a day of happiness and joy that the Palestinian people have not witnessed for a century.""

The 38 years of Israeli presence in the Gaza strip have officially ended.

Palestinians were overjoyed at the sight of the burning synagogues, planting flags in the midst of it all, and shouting cries of independence. Teenagers set fire to a few synagogues, letting out anger at Israel's occupation.

The fires did little damage to the concrete structures, but Abbas said that the Palestinians planned to destroy them fully.

Palestinian police admitted that there was not much they could or would do to stop this.

Last year, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy the synagogues, but this Sunday, under pressure from religious Jewish organizations, it reversed its decision. Palestinians were angry at the cabinet's Sunday vote.

The synagogues, as well as all community structures, including community centers, schools, and sports facilites, are the only physical remnants of the Israeli Gaza Strip presence since all residential structures have been destroyed."

""We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with our players which enables us to start the new season on time,"" said Mr. Bettman. ""The parties worked extremely hard over the past few months and we look forward to beginning what is certain to be another exciting year in the NHL.""
Mr. Bettman also noted that the Board of Governors has scheduled its next meeting for September 13-14 in New York City. At that meeting, the","has been canceled. The announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days. The dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players. The majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount. The club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million. Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said ""The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.""

This will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded. That year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off."
"German news magazine Der Spiegel reported today that a letter from an extremist Islamic organization calling itself ""Secret Organisation Group of Al-Qaeda of","the Arabian Peninsula"" was sent to the U.S. Embassy in Paris, France on Thursday.
The letter warned of attacks against Americans and Jews in Europe, according to the report. The group also claimed responsibility for the bombing of two synagogues in Tunisia last weekend.
A spokesperson from the U.S. State Department told ABC News today that they have not confirmed the existence of such a letter.
In its 2010 annual terrorism threat assessment, the United States government stated that there is no specific or credible information indicating","Jihad Organisation"" has appeared, a previously unheard-of organization, claiming responsibility for the explosions in London today. The BBC later released a statement, translated from Arabic, from the group. The text reads as follows:

In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate, may peace be upon the cheerful one and undaunted fighter, Prophet Muhammad, God's peace be upon him.

Nation of Islam and Arab nation: Rejoice for it is time to take revenge against the British Zionist Crusader government in retaliation for the massacres Britain is committing in Iraq and Afghanistan. The heroic mujahideen have carried out a blessed raid in London. Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters.

We have repeatedly warned the British Government and people. We have fulfilled our promise and carried out our blessed military raid in Britain after our mujahideen exerted strenuous efforts over a long period of time to ensure the success of the raid.

We continue to warn the governments of Denmark and Italy and all the Crusader governments that they will be punished in the same way if they do not withdraw their troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. He who warns is excused.

God says: ""You who believe: If ye will aid (the cause of) Allah, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly.

Molson Canada picks up Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. as the company maneuvers to make an entry into the craft beer,"market in Ontario.
Molson Coors Brewing Company Inc., a U.S.-based brewing giant, is acquiring the Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. for CAD 170 million (US$152 million). The deal will help the company expand its presence in Ontario and strengthen its position in the Canadian beer industry.
The acquisition of the Toronto-based microbrewery was made on May 31 by the Denver-headquartered firm through its subsidiary, Creemore Holdings Limited Partnership. It also includes","market.

Creemore Springs of Creemore, Ontario, produces the locally popular Creemore Springs lager. The merger will allow the company to retain its identity.

""The Creemore brand image and brewing craft will remain unchanged,"" Creemore Springs Brewery chairman Bill Wilder said. ""Molson understands and appreciates what is special about the Creemore brand and this makes them a great purchaser for the company.""

Industry observers are mixed on the benefits of the deal for Molson. The CBC reports one analyst suggests Molson may be trying to replicate the success of rival Labatt's premium beers. Others point out the small brewery model does not scale up well, and the attraction of a ""boutique"" beer fades in large-scale production.

Molson Coors Brewing Co., formed by the US$3.4 billion merger in February of two family-run companies, Canadian Molson and U.S. Coors brewing companies, is the fifth largest brewer in the world by volume. ( TSX:TAP.NV, NYSE:TAP)"
The World Health Organisation has announced that the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatments (ART) in developing countries is increasing significantly - more,"than doubling from 50,000 to 120,000 between 2003 and 2004.
The report also states that there are now an estimated 3 million people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa alone.
WHO's assistant director for HIV/AIDS Dr Marie-Paule Kieny said: ""We have reached a turning point in the response to AIDS.""
""There is no question that we can stop this pandemic if we act together,"" she added.
However","than doubling between December 2003 and June 2005. One million people are now getting the drugs they need, compared to just 400,000 eighteen months ago.

However, access to treatment is not growing as fast as demand, and the UN is unlikely to reach its target of treating three million people by the end of 2005 - just over half the people who need it. The longer-term target of universal treatment by 2010 is still likely to be met.

The figures show that the number of people receiving ART is increasing in every part of the globe, but not as quickly as people are contracting HIV. The numbers getting treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, the part of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS has increased threefold on a year ago, and doubled in the last six months. The same rate of growth as also been seen in Asia, the second-worst affected area.

The WHO's report highlights that the best progress has been made when governments have worked together with the WHO, the UN and other parterners. The report goes on to make recommendations for simplifying the process to enable treatment levels to be increased even faster.

The UN's target was based on what was hypothetically possible if all possible steps to provide treatment were taken. The report shows the while financial, political and technical steps have been made, other areas are falling short.

Pressure groups said that countries were reacting too slowly to the pandemic and called on the G8 to provide more sustainable funding for universal treatment for Aids.

UK international development minister Gareth Thompson said: ""We are committed to universal access to HIV treatments by 2010. We will spend £1.5bn in the next three years on Aids, including £150m on orphans."""
A recent survey conducted by the American Cancer Society has turned up some surprising results: Americans generally hold false beliefs about the nature of cancer and its treatment,".
The study, which was published in the journal CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, found that most respondents thought cancer is hereditary (it isn't) or caused by stress (it isn't), and many said they believed chemotherapy causes nausea, fatigue and hair loss. In fact, none of these side effects are common among patients treated with chemo.
""We were surprised to find so much misperception,"" lead researcher Dr. Otis Brawley told NBC News. ""People think it's a death sentence, but only 2",", even though many believe they are well informed.

Health experts say this ignorance could be dangerous: People may be making poor health decisions -- avoiding cancer screenings or rejecting potentially life-saving treatments -- based on their incorrect notions.

The most common misconception is that surgery causes cancer to spread. Decades ago, cancer often was not discovered until it was very advanced. At that stage, surgical efforts were rarely successful, and many patients died soon after procedures were performed. This may have given rise to the mistaken belief that the surgeries caused the disease to worsen.

Another commonly held myth is that there is a cure for cancer, but the medical industry is withholding it in order to continue profiting from the sale of less effective treatments and medications.

Believers in this ""conspiracy theory"" may not be guided by it in making their personal health decisions, though. The American Cancer Society says that even though many people are suspicious of the medical industry in general, they have a trusting relationship with their own physicians and are likely to follow their advice.

Almost 20 percent of the people surveyed felt that medications for cancer pain were ineffective.

About 10 percent expressed the belief that cancer could be cured with a positive attitude alone, while a similar number felt that there was no effective treatment for cancer.

The fact is, cancer survival and treatments -- including pain management -- have vastly improved in the last thirty years.

Results of the survey appear in the August 1 issue of Cancer, a journal published by the American Cancer Society."

Iraq has carried out the first executions since the demise of the Saddam Hussein regime. Three men convicted of murder were hanged,"on Monday in Baghdad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said.
The three were executed at Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad. They had been sentenced to death by an Iraqi court after being found guilty of killing two members of the security forces last year.

The British public is being invited to discuss what sort of country they want theirs to be and how it can accommodate people from all over the world who wish to live here.
It seems that Mr Blair feels that this will help him deal with the issue of immigration in Britain, which he has described as one of the biggest issues facing his government.

Blair sais also that the Kyoto Protocol doesn't go far enough.

Brazil is threatening to break the patent of US-based Abbott Laboratories as it pushes ahead with its programme to supply its people with,"affordable medication.
The country's health ministry has given a 10-day ultimatum for the firm to agree to licence local manufacturers, reports Reuters.
It comes after Brazilian authorities launched an investigation into whether the company had abused its monopoly on a heart drug by increasing prices in the country.
Abbott said that it would not license any new producers until the probe was over and that it had already offered to discuss the matter with the government.
""We are open to dialogue,"" said spokesman Mauricio Almeida. ""","free AIDS drugs.

Brazil has given Abbott a deadline of July 7 to cut the prices of its drug Kaletra or a Brazilian company will begin cloning it. This move would test recent World Trade Organization concessions allowing poor countries to produce generic drugs for local health emergencies.

Abbott has said that Brazil's demand goes ""against the spirit"" of the WTO agreement, since it has the ninth largest economy in the world, and that this could damage future research for improved treatments.

Previous programmes have been negotiated between companies and governments to produce generic versions of AIDS drugs, but this is the first time a country has threatened to use powers negotiated at the WTO by producing the drug without the cooperation of the patent holder.

Several campaign groups are supporting the move, hoping that other developing countries will be able to take the lead of Brazil and produce generic drugs for their own populations. Michael Bailey, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam International, said: ""The impact of breaking the patent would be enormous. If a major country such as Brazil goes through with this, not only will it help ensure sustainability of their excellent treatment programme, it will set a hugely important precedent for other countries.""

The US Chamber of Commerce has issued a statement urging Brazil to reconsider and suggesting that the move could create a rift between the countries. Thomas Donohue, Chamber President and CEO said: ""Brazil’s threat to strip patent rights from a U.S. company should concern all investors and every business around the world because of the precedent it sets for the treatment of intellectual property."""
Millions of origami cranes have been dropped on Thailand's three southern provinces following violence between the government and ethnic minority Muslim populations,".
Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said he was saddened by the deaths, which occurred after troops were sent to restore order in the troubled region.
The army has deployed 10,000 soldiers to quell unrest that erupted last month when a soldier shot dead two Malay-Muslim civilians.
A spokesman for the group behind the campaign told Al Jazeera that it had launched its protest because ""people are suffering"".
""We want peace,"" said Nattawut Saikua, who is also a member of",". The move has been called a ""goodwill gesture"" towards Muslims.

Up to 120 million such paper sculptures were dropped on Thailand's three southern-most provinces, Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. Tensions in this area have increased recently, peaking with the recent death of 85 demonstrators arrested during a protest. The government blamed their deaths on physical weakness due to fasting in the month of Ramadan as the cause, as most if not all the deaths occurred during transport of up to 500 arrested protestors. Critics of the Thai government have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, blaming the ""over-eagerness"" of Thai security forces as the cause of the deaths.

The dispersal was timed to coincide with the birthday of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and has generated much interest from the rest of the country's predominantly Buddhist population.
The cranes were built by citizens throughout Thailand and had peace messages written on them. The southern, Muslim provinces are often considered neglected by a north that is larger and of the majority ethnic group. Some have welcomed the goodwill gesture, but critics in both the north and south have said that the resources would have been better spent solving the problems in the south. Some Islamic leaders in the south have also expressed concerns that the gesture may not be properly understood by Muslims, as the crane carries no cultural significance with them."
"In the wake of a United States Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. New London on eminent domain last week, a California man has proposed","that his own property be used for an amusement park and golf course.
The case involved Susette Kelo and her neighbors who were ordered to sell their homes by the city of New London, Connecticut so that they could be taken over by private developers who would build a hotel, conference center and offices. The residents lost their lawsuit when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in June that local governments can exercise eminent domain powers to transfer land from one private owner to another if it is done for economic development purposes.
In response to the decision, John Berlau, director of regulatory studies","that Justice David Souter's New Hampshire home be seized by the state and a hotel be built on the site. Logan Darrow Clements faxed a letter to town officials in Weare, New Hampshire June 28, 2005 that justified the action as such:

""The justification for such an eminent domain action is that our hotel will better serve the public interest as it will bring in economic development and higher tax revenue to Weare.""

Justice Souter, who was in the majority ruling in the Kelo case, has lived at the farmhouse in Weare since he was 11 years old. Clements indicated that it was necessary to build on that location because ""it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans."" The action has given rise to a great deal of support nationwide, as many are writing to the councilors of the small town of Weare to voice their approval for the proposal.

The proposal for the ""Lost Liberty Hotel"", as it is to be called, features a number of components which seem to focus on the libertarian leanings of its designer. A dining room, called the ""Just Desserts Cafe"" and a museum based on the ""loss of freedom in America"" are two such components. Instead of a Bible provided by the Gideons (a standard item placed in most American hotel rooms), each guest will receive a free copy of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged."
People all over the Netherlands are voting today in a referendum on the EU constitution. This the first national referendum for two hundred years and it is non,"-binding, but will be taken very seriously by politicians and the media. The result of the poll is expected to be announced tomorrow morning.
The government has been campaigning hard for a Yes vote, while the No side have been organising street protests against the treaty. In fact, there's so much publicity about this that I can't help feeling that we're being bombarded with propaganda from both sides. It seems as if every newspaper article or radio programme contains some reference to the referendum.
I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before. A few","-binding. Though most major political parties have stated they will abide by the referendum if the outcome is sufficiently clear and a large enough percentage of the voters have actually voted.
The question put to voters will be:

:Bent U voor of tegen instemming door Nederland met het verdrag tot vaststelling van een grondwet voor Europa?
:""Are you for or against approval by the Netherlands of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe?""

All the main political parties have asked for a voor (for, or yes) vote. However polls have been saying that two-thirds of the people will be voting tegen (against, or no).

One reason for people to vote no is the expansion of the European Union with large countries like Turkey, which they fear will cause less influence for the smaller countries. The view of an European super state in which the Netherlands would loose its own identity is another reason for voting no. Some of the no voters do this to show they don't agree with the current political situation and the supposed risen prices since the introduction of the euro.

As of 14:00 CET, 9% more voters had turned up for the referendum than for the European elections.

Allawi said: ""I have information from my government and I am talking about official sources that there is an agreement between the American forces and the government of Iraq for the establishment of two permanent bases.""

""We are discussing it with our",", Samir Sumaidaie, declared to reporters that the international body of the United Nations helped the regime of Saddam Hussein. This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's Oil-for-Food program with Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali although there is no charge against him in the report.

In an interview with Voice of America reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie said: ""In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later.... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program.""

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.

After being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said: ""Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him.""

On Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: ""We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it."""
"Bitmover, the company producing a management program for computer source code named Bitkeeper (BK), announced on April 5 that it will no longer","sell its software to any organization in Japan. This decision came after a court ruled on March 31 that BK is an unauthorized copy of IBM's Rational Purify Plus and ordered IBM to pay $20 million in damages.
Bitkeeper was developed by German-born Karl Gunter Linus Fendrich, who founded Bitmover Inc. in California in 1997. It has been used in many companies including Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp., Canon Inc. and Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. The software analyzes programs written","be providing a free version of its product.

As a result of Bitmover's announcement, the programmer who wrote the original Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds, stated on a mailing list that he ""decided to not use BK mainly because he needs to figure out the alternatives"". As to an alternative to Bitkeeper, Torvalds hinted that he is considering Monotone but that Subversion, a recent replacement for CVS, is out of the running. Bitkeeper was originally developed to allow Torvalds to manage code contributions more easily, according to Jeremy Andrews at Kerneltrap.org, and was previously provided to kernel developers free of charge, though it was restricted in its use.

Bitkeeper is the software that Torvalds and hundreds of other Linux developers use to manage submissions of code to the Linux kernel, the heart of the computer operating systems referred to as ""Linux"" or ""GNU/Linux"". Linux is distributed in many different forms, bundled with other software by companies such as Red Hat, Novell, and Linspire.

While the details are not clear, it appears from Andrews' article that Bitmover's decision to stop releasing the free version of Bitkeeper is related to a dispute with Torvalds' employer, Open Source Development Labs (OSDL).

According to Kerneltrap, an OSDL contractor had been reverse engineering the free version of Bitkeeper in order to make an open source replacement, which is prohibited by the license under which the free version of Bitkeeper is released. Nevertheless, Torvalds notes in his post that he is ""personally very happy with BK, and with Larry McVoy, the CEO of Bitmover."""

The aircraft maintenance program started in the 1970s and was suspended in the late 1990s when the former workers started to show signs of medical problems ranging from memory loss to neurological problems.

The third Test ended in a draw (with England one wicket away from a win), and England narrowly won the fourth Test in Nottingham by three wickets after the English enforced follow on after a poor first innings by Australia.

The fifth and final Test started on 8 September at the Oval in London. It entered its final day evenly balanced with all results still possible and the destination of the urn still in doubt. Australia needed to win to force a 2-2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give them to England, ending 18 years and eight series of Australian dominance. In the end, England managed to bat out the final day, and a draw ensured the Ashes were coming back to England.

Kevin Pietersen and Ashley Giles hit personal bests of 158 and 59 respectively, to bat out the best part of the last day. Pieterson's 158 was his maiden test century, and included 7 sixes. Early in the day, Australia looked to be in with a chance of winning the match, with early wickets leaving England at 67 for 3. Giles and Pietersen's century partnership, though, left Australia with no hope of catching England in the remains of the day, sealing England's Ashes win since 1987.

England's next Tests will be an away series in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the world champions Australia will play an ICC World XI (which inclues Kevin Pietersen, Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff) in the Johnnie Walker Super Series in early October."
Space.com reported yesterday on a picture of a planet taken by the Very Large Telescope located in Chile. The European Southern Observatory's,"VLT is one of the world's largest telescopes, and its 8-meter main mirror is the biggest ever put into space. It can take pictures that are up to 250 times sharper than those from the Hubble telescope.
The image above was taken with the VLT's Adaptive Optics facility (NAOMI), which allows for high resolution images even when looking through turbulence in the atmosphere. This particular image shows a planet orbiting a star about 470 light years away. It has been named OGLE-TR-132b","telescope, which was used to capture the picture, has made the first confirmed discovery of a planet orbiting another star.

Scientists have been trying to locate planets outside our own solar system for nearly 10 years. Inferences of nearly 150 planets in other solar systems have been observed so far by using instruments and measurements that only suggest the existence of another planet. Until now, no planet has been confirmed by the means of a photographed image. There was, months earlier, another team of scientists who took pictures of what might be another planet, but that image remains controversial because it shows what may be an even more distant object instead.

The research team that photographed the planet with its host star was led by Ralph Neuhaeuser of the Astrophysical Institute &amp; University Observatory (AIU). ""The detection of the faint object near the bright star is certain,"" he told Space.com on Friday.

The new image contains the star, GQ Lupi, with an orbiting planet. It is smaller than our sun, 70% the size, and is located 400 light-years away from our solar system. The planet is nearly twice the size of Jupiter. Unlike our sun which is 4.6 billion years old, the GQ Lupi star is approximately 1 million years old and is considered very young for a star. The planet orbiting GQ Lupi is three times further out than Neptune's orbit around our sun, and scientists estimate the orbiting period to be about 1,200 years. The planets wide orbiting distance from the GQ Lupi was an important element for enabling the photograph to be taken.

The planet, much like the star it orbits, is very hot &amp;mdash; about 2,000 degrees Kelvin &amp;mdash; so despite the detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, which at that temperature would make it gaseous, there is no expectation it might support life.

The discovery will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics."
"Young Quakers who planned to take part in the World Gathering of Young Friends at Lancaster University, England have been unable to attend after having","their visas rejected.
The group from New Zealand and Australia was told that they would not be allowed into Britain because they did not meet immigration requirements.
They were also denied a refund for the £100 fee paid by each member of the 25-strong party to register with the Home Office.
""We're very disappointed,"" said John Bell, one of the leaders of the group, which arrived in London on June 30. ""It seems we are being treated as criminals.""
A spokesman for the British High Commission in Wellington, New Zealand, said: ""","their visas denied.

Their absence has been a cause of ""hurt"" at the meetings. Sara Wolcott of Pacific Yearly Meeting on the Western coast of America wrote in a journal on the WGYF website: ""I saw in a workshop for Friends planning to meet in Kenya how much the absence of so many Friends was felt; the gathering felt incomplete. We desperately wanted our brothers and sisters to be with us, I know they wanted to be here too.""

Most of the denials were for economic reasons, if someone doesn't have a high enough income or a fixed job it can be assumed that they will stay in the country for work. Representatives from the gathering now plan to go to Kenya in October to share some of the programme with those who were unable to come.

Despite the missing Friends, the gathering has brought together a mix of different Quaker traditions in a positive atmosphere that has been appreciated by participants. Many Quakers worship in silence (unprogrammed meetings) while others, particularly in America and Africa, have ministers like other churches. Quakers also have differences of opinion over theological issues, including even the existence of God, but the young Friends have not found this to be an obstacle to coming together. Unlike many traditional Christian sects, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, encourage each member to explore his or her own relationship with God.

Chrissy Muhr of Northwest Yearly Meeting (Northwest US) wrote: ""I've been really impressed by how the mix of worship styles has been handled. Almost all the programmed Friends I've spoken to have some prior experience of unprogrammed worship. For me, the hardest thing has been not falling asleep during long periods of silence - the long week has begun to take its toll."""
A new redesigned US $10 bill was introduced at a ceremony yesterday on Ellis Island. The new bill adds three new background colors; red,", blue and green to the original design which is predominately yellow.
The design of the bill will change from an old-fashioned look to one that more resembles today’s technology. It also has a watermark image of Thomas Jefferson in the paper itself.
“We are taking this opportunity to tell our nation’s history through the people who helped build America,” said Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. “These faces reflect our diversity as a country.”
The back of the bill features images of famous landmarks such as Mount Rushmore, Independence Hall and the Lincoln Memorial.",", yellow and orange. It continues to feature Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. The $10 bill is the third US bill to switch from the traditional green. The $20 and $50 bills were redesigned to feature color within the past two years.

The improvements in digital technology have made it much easier for counterfeiters. ""Ten years ago, 1 percent of (counterfeit) bills were produced on digital equipment. These days, 56 percent are produced on digital equipment, and the technology is more accessible to the general population,"" said Eric Zahren, spokesman for the Secret Service.

According to the Treasury Department, to be able to keep ahead of counterfeiters currency will need to continue to be updated every seven to ten years. The $10 bill was last redesigned in 2000. ""The intention was not to create a counterfeit-proof note&amp;mdash;which is basically impossible&amp;mdash;but one that's harder to duplicate and easier to authenticate,"" said Zahren. This new bill includes many new and enhanced security features such as color-shifting ink, a watermark, microprinting and a security thread

Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said in a statement ""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. Government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure."" The new $10 bill is expected to go into circulation in early 2006."

The race was won by War Emblem who went on to win the Belmont Stakes and become the first horse since Affirmed in 1978-79 to sweep the Triple Crown.
War Emblem finished ahead of Funny Cide (second) and Ten Most Wanted (third).
""It's unbelievable,"" said winning trainer Bob Baffert. ""I can't even think about it.""
Baffert is now one of only five trainers to have won all three races of the Triple Crown","the historic Pimlico Downs. Favorite Afleet Alex evaded near disaster to win the $1,000,000 graded stakes and the second leg of the triple crown. The race ended the hopes of long shot Giacomo for the triple crown, which includes the Kentucky Derby, The Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes.

At the top of the home stretch the front-runner Scrappy T bolted to the right in response to a whip change by his Jockey Ramon Dominguez. Afleet Alex was blocked by T's rump and his neck was forced to the left. The horse was forced to its knees but stayed on its feet, rocketing to the inside of Scrappy T to take the win by 4 1/2 lengths going away. Scrappy T held on for second, Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo finished third, and Sun King took fourth.

The winner paid $8.60. He topped a $152.60 exacta ($2), a $872 triple (trifecta) ($2) and a $10,362.30 superfecta ($1)."

"House Democrats called for an investigation into possible voting fraud and irregularities during the 2004 U.S. presidential election, according","to a letter released Thursday by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI).
Conyers, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he has received more than 50 complaints from voters who believe their votes were not counted or that others cast ballots in their names. He also cited reports of long lines at polling stations, faulty voting machines and allegations of intimidation of minority voters.
""We must find out whether there is any basis to these claims,"" Conyers wrote. ""If we do not investigate now, it will be too late","to a Dec. 23 letter from House Representative David Wu (D-OR).

Thousands of Ohio citizens have reported experiencing problems casting their votes due to long lines at polling places, malfunctioning voting machines, inexplicable numbers of votes cast, and disenfranchisement in urban areas.

""The integrity of our democracy is at stake. We need to give the American people confidence that each and every vote will be properly counted and that the democratic electoral process is respected,"" Wu said. ""I also understand concerns about the conflict of interest of having an official in charge of running elections in a key state also heading a presidential campaign. I agree that Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell's dual role calls into question any election decision he made that favored Republicans.""

Other Congressmen including John Conyers (D-MI), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and Robert Wexler (D-FL) voiced similar concerns, and requested an investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), citing specific cases in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, and California.

In December, Conyers, the Ranking Democrat on the House Committee on the Judiciary, issued a series of letters about voting irregularities to the media, campaign officials, and manufacturers of voting equipment. These letters seek to collect and preserve information regarding the conduct of the election.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office previously reported on voting irregularities in eariler presidential elections.

A September 14, 2004 GAO report on the 2000 presidential elections detailed changes the DOJ implemented to try to ensure voter access to polls, and the importance of monitoring election-day activities. The report warned that allegations in the 2000 election lacked sufficient specifics to enable the DOJ to perform and adequate investigation and recommended that more precise information be collected regarding voting for the 2004 presidential election."
"Missing American teen Natalee Holloway, who vanished on the Dutch island of Aruba two weeks ago, is feared to be","dead after her mother arrived in the Caribbean and met with prosecutors.
Natalee's father Dave Holloway said he has been informed that his 18-year-old daughter may have died as a result of an accident or suicide.
""They think she might have drowned,"" Mr Holloway told reporters at his home in Tampa, Florida. ""There was no evidence of foul play.""
His wife Beth also spoke briefly about her meeting with prosecutors in Aruba yesterday.
""We were able to talk to them today for a little while","dead today following a suspect's statement earlier this morning. The suspect, who is yet to be named, told police that ""something bad happened"" to the missing teen. Police Commissioner District 1 Gerold Dompig said that the suspect was leading police to a scene, where it is believed a major update to the case is to be found.

Two security guards were taken into police custody early last week: 28-year-old Abraham Jones and 30-year-old Mickey John. Additionally, three teenagers who were believed to be the last people to have seen Halloway are now under custody. Among the three teenagers is 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe, 21-year-old Depak Kalpoe, and 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, a friend of the brothers and son to a Judicial Servant.

Anita van der Sloot, mother of suspect Joran van der Sloot, told American news network CNN that her son stated to her that he was ""innocent"", and even offered to speak to Holloway's family. No announcement from police has yet confirmed the death of Holloway."
"A Romanian student officer on mission in Iraq, Major Robertino Ciobanu, was wounded on Sunday by a bullet fired unintentionally","during the firing of an American tank.
The incident took place when the US soldiers were shooting at some targets located 20 km from Baghdad. The bullets fell into the area where Major Ciobanu and his colleagues were stationed. The major was slightly injured but he is doing fine now.
Major Ciobanu has been sent to Italy for treatment. He will be transferred back to his country next week.
A spokesman of the US military command said that the soldier who shot Major Ciobanu had not intended to wound him.
""We are sorry about this","by a colleague from the multinational force in the country. The injury took place in front of the Presidential Palace of Baghdad.

The officer's colleague accidentally fired on him while unloading weapons, a standard procedure for military personnel when they are returning from patrol missions. Ciobanu was wounded in the leg, but after being treated at hospital, he was declared out of danger.

Major Ciobanu is currently involved in training new Iraqi security personnel. Romania has one of the largest contingents in Iraq, with 830 soldiers. At the end of March, three Romanian journalists were kidnapped in Iraq, with the kidnappers later demanding that Romania pull its troops out of the country or else the journalists would be killed."

Representatives of both the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) signed a peace pledge today in the,"Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
The agreement ends 21 years of war between the two parties that has killed an estimated two million people. The deal is also expected to lead to South Sudan gaining independence from Khartoum next year.
Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir said his country had accepted all the demands made by the SPLM. He added that he was optimistic about the future of relations with the south.
""We have reached a good understanding on all issues,"" Bashir told reporters after signing the accord. ""There are no","Kenyan capital Nairobi, under the watchful eye of United Nations ambassadors.

According to the BBC, the document concluded with a memorandum saying that ""prompt completion of the peace process is essential for all the people of Sudan"". The actual peace treaty should, according to the pledge, be signed no later than December 31st 2004. While the pledge focuses mainly on the fights between the rebels in the south and the Khartoum-based government in the north, there is also attention for the ongoing crisis in east Sudan (Darfur).

Several aid agencies have criticized the UN for taking a weak stand against the Sudanese government. The Security Council has already signed two resolutions threatening economic sanctions against Sudan if the government does not disarm its troops in Darfur, but, so the BBC reports, the violence is continuing. The civil war in Darfur was sparked in 2003, when insurgents started attacking government buildings. The Arab government in Khartoum subsequently sent troops to the region, which have been reported to mass-violate human rights of the black Africans living in Darfur."
"In anticipation of a Security Council vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the International Criminal Court, Sudan announced today it would reject","any ICC decision.
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said his country will not recognize or abide by an international court's verdict in the case against President Omar al-Bashir and other officials accused of genocide.
""We have already stated that we do not accept this court,"" he told reporters after meeting with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. ""If they issue a ruling, we will not recognize it.""
Asked whether Sudan would refuse to hand over suspects if ordered to do so, Mr. Os","any United Nations resolution that required war crimes suspects to be tried abroad. The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the French delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week.

Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, ""Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese &amp;mdash; whether he is a rebel or government official &amp;mdash; outside the Sudan: we are totally against it."" In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group ""Justice and Equality of Movement,"" said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace.

Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to human rights abuses in Darfur. Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts.

The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias. It has often been suggested that this qualifies as genocide, and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights."

An accompanying written report by the officer who took the taped confession says; ""Couey admitted that this was not the first child he had ever touched, however, this is the first time he was caught."" The officer continues, ""Couey admitted to molesting his wife's daughter, however, she agreed not to report the incident if he left the house and gave her a divorce, which he did."" CNN was unable to locate Couey's former wife.

The revelation calls into question the way Couey has been dealt with by officials over the years. He spoke on the 1991 tape about how he ""needs help"" and ""wants help"".

Mary Doyle, a Citrus County probation official, said Monday that if they had known Couey was a registered sex offender, they may have been able to keep him away from Jessica Lunsford. Florida Courts do not provide probation workers with criminal backgrounds of their probationers, even in the case of registered sexual offenders like Couey, Doyle said. With that information they might have tried harder to locate him when he failed to report in with probation officials last November. When detectives did finally catch up with him, they learned he had been living across the road from Jessica."
Australians and New Zealanders throughout the world stood still for their national war memorial days in remembrance of the failed Australian and New Zealand Army Corps,"(ANZAC) landing at Gallipoli on 25th April, 1915.
Their aim was to break through Turkish lines and secure a sea route from Europe to Russia during WWI. The campaign ended with over 8000 Allied casualties and nearly 40,000 Turks killed or wounded.

Afghanistan is the world’s biggest supplier of heroin, accounting for about 85% of global production. The country has been producing more than 600 tons of opium annually since 1994, when Taliban regime took control over most of the country. In 2000, Afghanistan produced 3,400 tons of opium, which increased to 4,600 tons in 2001. Opium poppy is grown on an estimated 152,000 hectares","'s supply. Opium may account for one-third of Afghanistan's GDP.

On Sunday's CNN's Late Edition, Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai laid the blame for the explosion of opium production in his country at the feet of the US and Britain.

The failure is theirs, not ours."" Kazai said. ""Where international money and creation of forces for destruction of poppies was concerned, it was ineffective and delayed and half-hearted.""

Karzai was responding to allegations in Sunday's New York Times that his government was dragging their heels in reducing the opium production in Afghanistan.

Walsh will take over from current BA boss Martin Broughton on September 1st and he will also become a non-executive director at Iberia Airlines, which is part owned by BA's parent company International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG).
The appointment was made following an interview process involving several other candidates including Sir Roger Carr, chairman of Centrica and John Sutherland, who is currently non-executive director of Standard Chartered Bank.

"The Senator Julian McGauran in the Australian Senate had made an ""unseemly"" gesture across the floor of the Senate whilst it was in session",".
The incident occurred on 27 June 1984, when he pointed his finger at a female senator who was sitting on the government bench and yelled: ""You're a fat cunt!"" He later claimed that he did not know she was female.
Senator McGauran apologised to the Senate for his behaviour but this apology was rejected by the Senate as being insufficient.
On 30 July 1984, Senator McGauran resigned from the Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division). On 5 September 198","on August 11, apparently as a result of interjections about a division taking place.

Whilst this was not immediately debated, Senator Bob Brown had asked the Acting Deputy President of the Senate to look into the matter. Later the President of the Senate ruled that the gesture was ""unseemly but not obscene"".

This ruling caused a fierce debate, with Senator Brown saying that McGauran's ""arrogant and disgusting"" actions exemplified the Government's attitude towards its new-found Senate majority, whilst Senator Ron Boswell, the National Party Senate leader, had criticised Brown of hypocrisy, stating that Brown had ""broken every law in Australia"" and ""every law in Tasmania"" (which Bartlett noted as a point of order as being hyperbole).

Senator McGauran then spoke, stating that he ""regretted his actions"". Brown however noted that this was not an unqualified apology. A motion was then put that the President's ruling be dissented from, which debate was set for another sitting. Senator Chris Evans, the Labor Senate leader and Senator Brown had called for McGauran's sacking as Chief Government whip; his National Party superiors have said that they will speak to McGauran about the incident."

"According to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Iraq election was a blow against global terrorism. He vowed to stand by Iraq as","it takes steps toward democracy and he praised Iraqi voters for turning out in large numbers despite threats of violence from extremists.
The elections were held on 30 January. The turnout was reportedly between 65% and 75%. In Baghdad, there was an average of 82% participation. This is higher than the 41% that participated in the December referendum.
There are some who question whether this vote will lead to any improvement in security or stability in Iraq.

It is also a blow right to the heart of the global terrorism that threatens destruction not just in Iraq but in Britain and virtually every major country around the world.""

"Rabies is a disease that has no cure and nearly everyone it infects is dead just two weeks after the symptoms show. And yet,","rabies still affects more than 50,000 people worldwide every year.
The reason for this is because most of us don't know how to protect ourselves from it. But we can! Here are seven ways you can avoid getting rabies:
1. Avoid wildlife contact
If you live in an area with lots of wild animals, try not to come into contact with them. This means staying away from stray dogs or cats, especially if they look sickly or have bites on their fur. Also, be careful when walking your own pets outside as well","last week a teenage girl named Jeanna Giese was released from a hospital having been successfuly treated. She became the first known person to recover from the disease without vaccination.

On September 12, 2004, Jeanna &amp;mdash; a 15 year old from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin&amp;mdash; was bitten by a bat while attending church. By the time she saw a doctor about fatigue and numbness, it was October 18, and the bat incident was not brought up until several days later. Usually when there is a possibility of rabies, doctors will vaccinate patients: the vaccine has a chance to act before the symptoms appear. In Jeanna's case it was too late to try to vaccinate, and her doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin devised a new treatment. Jeanna was put into a drug-induced coma for a week, and doctors began an intensive treatment to prop up her nervous system until her natural immunity recovered enough to fight the disease.

By surviving and recovering, Jeanna became the only person known in medicine to overcome rabies without a vaccine. She is not yet fully recovered: the effects of the coma are still apparent, and she has difficulty with movement. Yet the doctors believe that she is getting well much faster than they expected, and feel that Jeanna will be able to return to her high school studies, needing only physical and occupational therapy.

The novel treatment is hailed by doctors as promising, but needs analysis and verification on another human. Jeanna's is the sixth case of human recovery from a rabies infection, but the other five people were vaccinated against rabies either before infection, or before the symptoms appeared."
"Today, AOL had announced that it is launching a new VoIP service to be named TotalTalk. TotalTalk is much like Google T","alk and MSN Messenger as it allows you to make calls from your PC to any phone in the world for free.
To use this service, all you need is an Internet connection, a headset with microphone and speakers or a corded telephone. You can also call mobile phones but only if they are GSM based (GSM = Global System for Mobile communications). The service will work on Windows 2000/XP, Mac OS X and Linux.
If you don't have a broadband connection at home, then you can still use this service by purchasing a","alk due to its unification of verbal conversation and instant messenger into one client. However, much like Skype, client-to-phone conversations are possible. Other features include caller ID, voice mail integration with e-mail, three-way calling, and more.

Unlike AOL's current VoIP service, TotalTalk will not require AOL membership. However, access to this service may cost upwards of $34.99 per month.

Later this week, AOL will also release its new instant messenger client, Triton. Triton will contain a softphone feature that can be used with TotalTalk."
"Margaret Pardoel, mother of the first Australian soldier to be killed in Iraq since the commencement of hostilities, has expressed anger over the","Government's decision not to send more troops.
The Prime Minister and his senior ministers have been accused of putting their careers ahead of the lives of soldiers after they decided against increasing Australia's commitment to the US-led invasion force.
Mrs Pardoel said she was furious that her son, Private Damien Peach, had died for nothing.
""I am very disappointed with the whole thing,"" Mrs Pardoel told The Age from her home at Woodend, Victoria. ""They are playing politics with our kids.""
Privately, some members of Mr Howard's cabinet","death of her only son, a father of three, who was about to return home to Australia and had been planning a career change. Mrs Pardoel and husband John were devastated by the loss of their only son.

Mrs Pardoel said she opposes the war. ""I think it's just cold-blooded murder. Look at all those young American boys that have been slaughtered,"" she said. ""I don't think this should have gone on ... He said to me one night he phoned, he said, 'Mum there's nowhere to hide here, it's just so dangerous, there's nowhere to hide'.""

Thirty-five year old Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel had been on his last flight when the C-130 Hercules he was aboard crashed north of Baghdad yesterday, killing ten personnel. He was serving with the British Royal Air Force (RAF), to which he had transferred several years ago from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), as Navigator in 47 Squadron Lyneham RAF.

Mr Pardoel had been expecting to return in July to his wife and three children in Australia, where they had recently bought a new house in Canberra.

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, says he is saddened to hear of the man's death.

""I want his family to know, and his friends to know, that he certainly did not die in vain, that this tragic accident occurred - or this tragedy because it may not have been an accident - but this tragedy occurred on a day when 65 per cent of the people of Iraq went out and voted,"" he said."
"Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found","in Montana.
The researchers from the University of Kansas and North Carolina State University studied the remains of the T-rex for more than two years to determine what it was like when alive. They discovered that the dinosaur had a layer of fat under its skin, which is similar to today's alligators and birds. The team also found evidence of feathering on the animal's arms and legs.
""We think this specimen may be one of the earliest records of feathers on land,"" said Lindsay Zanno, lead author of the study published in the journal Science. ""This","in a sandstone formation in Montana.

MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science.

Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. “Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.”, paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Richard A. Hengst of Purdue University said the finding ""opens the door for research into the protein structure of ancient organisms, if nothing else. While we think that nature is conservative in how things are built, this gives scientists an opportunity to observe this at the chemical and cellular level.""

Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said the discovery was ""pretty exciting stuff."" ""You are actually getting into the small-scale biology of the animal, which is something we rarely get the opportunity to look at."""
"Speaking in Texas, President Bush in a Wednesday address to the American Legislative Exchange Council in the city of Grapevine said, ""","We're working closely with our allies on Iraq. The government there is doing its part by approving an amnesty law for Sunnis who have fought against us.""
Bush also said that he has been talking to leaders from all parties involved in Iraq and that they are making progress toward peace. He added that he will be discussing this matter further at his summit next week with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of Iraq.
""Iraqi leaders must take steps to achieve national unity,"" he said.
The president also spoke about Iran saying that it was very important to make","The violence in recent days in Iraq is a grim reminder of the enemies we face.""

""After September the 11th, I made a commitment to the American people that the United States of America will not wait to be attacked again."" Bush said. ""We will take the fight to the enemy, and we will defend our freedom.""

There has been debate within the Administration as to how to refer to the ongoing conflict. In recent appearances, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has avoided using the word ""war"", preferring the phrase ""global struggle against violent extremism."" Bush's speech marks a return to the existing phrase ""war on terror"". In the speech he acknowledged that the struggle is against those who use terror to achieve their goals, implicitly recognising that the term ""war on terror"" may be misleading.

""Make no mistake about it, this is a war against people who profess an ideology, and they use terror as a means to achieve their objectives,"" he said.

Of the military strategy in Iraq, Bush said that coalition forces continue to hunt down terrorists, and the Iraqi security forces are being trained to take on more responsibility. ""As Iraqis stand up, Americans and coalition forces will stand down,"" Bush said. ""And we're making progress. More and more Iraqi units are more and more capable of defending themselves.""

The return of American forces to U.S. soil will be event-driven decision, he said. A timetable for withdrawal is not practical because it would give the enemy a tactical event upon which to plan.

Politically, Iraq's National Assembly is working on a constitution that members pledged to have ready by August 15. The Iraqi people would then vote on the constitution October 15. If passed, the new Iraqi government under a constitution would be elected December 15.

"The White House announced the selection of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World Bank, replacing John Wolfensohn who retires as acting president after 1","0 years.
The U.S. is expected to win a seat on the bank's board for Wolfowitz, an American economist and former assistant defense secretary in the administration of President George W. Bush.
Wolfowitz will be nominated by the United States, which has held the presidency since the bank was founded after World War II. He would replace Frenchman Donald J. Johnston, whose term expires June 30.
""We have been working closely with our colleagues at the bank over the past several weeks to identify candidates,"" said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino","0 years. The switch is expected to occur sometime in June.

The choice of Wolfowitz is raising controversy in Europe and developing nations. Known as hawkish and outspoken, Wolfowitz was a pro-Iraqi war neo-conservative in his role as deputy Secretary of Defense, and a chief architect in the build up to war with Iraq. Some question whether Wolfowitz, who was criticized for brushing aside European and NATO calls for caution before the Iraq war, would use the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as tool to extend U.S. foreign policy interests.

Historically, it has been the White House’s prerogative to name the candidate because the U.S. holds a majority on the 24 member board, but board members from nations other than the U.S. are seeking their own interviews to qualify the candidate before a change is made. ""The executive directors have agreed to conduct informal meetings over the coming days with the US nominee as part of the consultative process."" the IMF said in a statement. ""Thereafter, the executive directors will meet in a formal session to select the president at which time an official announcement of the outcome will be made,"" it said. The vote is set for March 31, the same day Wolfensohn retires.

Rob Nichols, the US Treasury spokesperson, said Wolfowitz has begun scheduling meetings with board members and that, ""Our nominee… looks forward to meeting with and listening to members of the World Bank board."" Reuters reported. In the meantime, Wolfowitz has worked to assure those with concerns of him, saying he would come with an open mind and no political program."

"United States President George W. Bush's nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security, Bernard Kerik, has declined to continue through Senate confirm","ation hearings after revelations that he employed an illegal immigrant as a housekeeper and did not pay income taxes on her wages.
Kerik resigned from his position as New York City police commissioner in December 2001 following criticism over the response to the September 11 attacks. He is currently CEO of Interfor Inc., a security firm based in New York.
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (Democrat-South Dakota) said yesterday that ""it would be very difficult"" for him to support Kerik's nomination because he","ation. In a letter to President Bush, Kerik explained that the immigration status of a housekeeper and nanny, as well as nonpayment of income tax on the housekeeper were his reasons for retracting.

However, Kerik's past dealings may have been the strongest reason for his decision to withdraw from the nomination. Newsweek has uncovered that as recently as 1998, a New Jersey judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kerik following a tangled web of lawsuits relating to unpaid bills on a condominum. Newsday and the Seattle Times have reported that Kerik may have business ties to the Mob and allegations of two extramarital affairs have arisen.

In addition, his windfall profit from stock options in Taser International (i.e. ""Taser guns"") with no apparent investment, has been under heavy investigation. Kerik received a profit of more than USD $6 million after selling his stock in early November, just before an Amnesty International report critical of Taser guns was released. Kerik had joined Taser International's board shortly after resigning as New York City's police commissioner; both the NYPD and Department of Homeland Security have purchased large amounts of Taser's non-lethal electroshock weapons."
Russian researchers warn that Western Siberia has begun to thaw as a result of global warming. The frozen peat bogs in this,"area contain vast reserves of methane, which is 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.
The melting permafrost will release massive amounts of the powerful gas into the atmosphere and cause even greater climate change.
Siberian scientists have long been sounding the alarm about the dangers posed by the melting of the region’s vast peat bog areas. They fear that the release of billions of tons of methane from these wetlands could trigger runaway global warming.
A team of researchers led by Sergey Zim","region may hold billions of tons of methane gas, which may be released into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

Sergei Kirpotin, of Tomsk State University warned New Scientist that the event is an ""ecological landslide that is probably irreversible and is undoubtedly connected to climatic warming"".

David Viner, of the University of East Anglia told The Guardian: ""When you start messing around with these natural systems, you can end up in situations where it's unstoppable"". He also warns that this event was not considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

In May, scientists from the University of Alaska found methane ""hotspots"" in eastern Siberia where the gas bubbles out from thawing permafrost bogs at a rate that prevents the surface from freezing.

The permafrost has been intact for 11,000 years and started melting 3 to 4 years ago, according to Kirpotin.

The newspaper reports that he is suffering from prostate cancer and may be given special treatment outside of the ICTY facility.
Milošević's lawyer, Peter Robinson, told the BBC: ""There are certain treatments which can only be done at a particular place."" He said it was unclear whether these would be available at the tribunal or not.

Sarwar had been involved in fighting since the early days of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001. He was one of the few local leaders to side with the government during the Taliban regime's brief return to power in 2005. In 2006 he joined the National Directorate for Security (NDS) programme to recruit former insurgents into the police or army. However, his commitment to the NDS programme was","at the road between Kabul and Jalalabad in Afghanistan in the early 1990s, was convicted today of torture and hostage-taking. The Court at Old Bailey in London found that Zardad pursued a reign of fear along his checkpoints and ordered summary executions and torture of innocent civilians. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.

Zardad denied all charges throughout the trials, and claimed he had been set up by enemies in Afghanistan.

""I have never killed anybody and if anybody in the whole of Afghanistan can produce that evidence against me then I will accept that crime,"" he said.

The case is considered to be a landmark in international law. British law allows the prosecution of crimes like torture and hostage-taking in the UK even if no British citizen was involved and the incidents occurred overseas. ""There are some crimes which are so heinous, such an affront to justice, that they can be tried in any country"", Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith said.

Zardad fled to the UK in 1998 after he had fought both the Russians and the Taliban in Afghanistan's long civil war. He settled in a suburban London home and was first confronted by BBC Journalist John Simpson in 2000. Simpson's report sparked a lengthy investigation that would eventually lead to British prosecutors travelling to Afghanistan and questioning Zardad's victims.

Australian broadcasters SBS report three deaths in violence centered around allegations of fraud in Sunday's election in the west African nation of,"Ivory Coast.
A spokesman for the station, which has reporters on the ground in Abidjan, said a woman was killed when her house was set ablaze and two others were shot dead as they went to vote.
The elections are being closely watched by international observers who hope that the poll will help bring an end to months of political unrest following disputed presidential polls last November.
Ivorian voters have been queuing since early this morning to cast their ballots. The country is one of Africa's biggest cocoa producers but its economy has suffered from","Togo. The election is held to choose a president to replace Togo's recently deceased ruler of 38 years, Gnassingbé Eyadéma.

Three candidates stood for the election: the son of the late president, Faure Gnassingbé, 74-year-old Emmanuel Akitani Bob, and Harry Olympio, a cousin of the man who lead Togo before the coup in 1963. A fourth candidate, Nicolas Lawson, also ran but removed himself from consideration 2 days before the election ""because of fears of fraud,"" said the Voice of America News.

The elder Gnassingbé died in February of this year while being transported out of the country for medical care. The Togolese army supported the son of the late ruler as an interim president in contravention of the constitution, which indicates that power should pass to the Speaker of the Parliament.

"An outbreak of cholera in West Africa has resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people, and United Nations (UN)","officials are warning that the disease is spreading rapidly.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that there have been at least 614 cases of the water-borne bacterial illness reported since April in Nigeria, Liberia and Guinea. The number of confirmed deaths stands at 529.

Hartl said the UN agency had sent","health officials are concerned that inadequate health services in the region could result in many more deaths.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that over 31,250 cases of cholera have been reported so far this year in nine West African countries. It has claimed 488 lives at this point. ""If we look at this year's trends, the figures are still going up in many countries,"" said John Mulangu, a senior regional advisor for the WHO. ""If cholera is not brought under control in certain regions, we will soon be talking of... 100,000 cases,"" he said. ""And hospitals and health centres will be overwhelmed. Last year we were not on this scale. The problem is getting worse,"" Mulangu said.

The UN says that the increase could also be related to the fact that due to poverty, many West Africans move around, sometimes out of the country, in order to receive higher wages for their work, and the region has been hit with heavy rains. This helps spread the disease, according to the UN.

""We are about to enter the harvest season where people will be moving around,"" said Herve Ludovic de Lys, the head of OCHA's West Africa office. ""The main goal is to halt the transmission of this disease,"" he said. ""It's not business as usual. This crisis needs a rapid response.""

The following West African nations have all been hit by cholera epidemics: Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Senegal. The WHO issued a statement on Thursday that more countries were at risk. ""Outbreaks are likely to spread to Central Africa - Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad - in the next weeks,"" it said."

The major contributors to the rise were increased transportation, healthcare, and education costs. In April the EU25 average rate of inflation was 2.1%, with Latvia having the highest rate at 7.1% and Sweden the lowest at 0.4%.

Despite the increase in the rate, Irish inflation remains very low - having hit 7% during 2000 and remaining around the 5% until the beginning of 2003. Another major factor easing any worries about the increase is Ireland's very strong GDP growth - expected to be around 5.5% this year

Oregon State University (OSU) animal researchers in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Dubois,"Regional Laboratory, have developed a new test for detecting porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), an important pig disease that causes diarrhea and death in young pigs.
The PCV2 test is being made available to producers through USDA-APHIS Veterinary Services at no charge. The test will be offered as part of routine testing by APHIS veterinarians on farms where there are suspicious outbreaks of swine dysentery or other diseases caused by PCV2. The test also can be ordered directly from USDA-",", Idaho-based Sheep Experiment Station released a report on an OSU-USDA study which was initiated in 1995 after breeders asked the government to determine why some rams bought as breeding studs showed no interest in females. The researchers are working under a $2.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in hopes of developing a test which can determine the likelihood of a ram being female-oriented before it is sold as a stud.

By studying difference in the animal's brains after slaughter, the study also showed what could be a biological determiner for what makes a ram male-oriented instead of female-oriented sexually. The scientists' results showed that the anterior preoptic area of the rams' hypothalamus was 50 percent smaller in male-oriented rams as opposed to female oriented rams. A 1991 study of human brains of AIDS victims showed a similar hypothalamus size difference between gay and heterosexual men.

The sheep researchers postulate that low levels of aromatase hormones in the brain of a developing male sheep fetus may have kept the brain from fully masculinizing, leading to sexually male-oriented rams.

""This lends further support to the idea that homosexuality has biological underpinnings,"" Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology, said in an interview with the Corvallis Gazette-Times.

Professor Stormshak believes that ""understanding sexual drives and the continuum of sexual behavior could possibly help explain the scientific basis of sexual assault and put an end to assertions that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."""

The driver of the bus was also killed in the accident. A sixth girl is currently being treated for injuries sustained in the crash.
According to local reports, the bus had been carrying students from two schools – one in Dublin and another in Co. Wicklow. It appears that the bus was heading toward its destination when it veered off the road and into a ditch.
A spokesperson for the Irish Road Safety Authority (RSA) said",", involving a school bus carrying fifty-one teenagers and two cars, occurred at 4.30pm on a straight section of the Navan to Kentstown road.

Apart from the five fatalities, six children in a critical state and nineteen others with less serious injuries have been admitted to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. Six more teenagers, also in a critical state, and twenty others with lesser injuries have been admitted to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, County Louth.

The bus was carrying secondary school students from four schools home when the accident occurred. At present it is unknown what caused the accident - but it is suspected that the two cars collided head on and the bus then attempted to swerve in order to avoid them, causing it to topple over. Several investigations have begun; including one by the Gardaí and one by Bus Eireann.

The accident was quickly responded to by an emergency plan which lead to fourteen ambulances, several fire engines, squad cars and a few helicopters arriving on the scene within minutes."
Apple Computer has formally acknowledged that the screens on some of its new iPod nano units are prone to scratching and cracking. The company,"is offering a free case for affected models, which were sold between September 2005 and January 2006.
Apple's admission came in an e-mail sent to customers who had registered their products with the company's support system. In it, the company stated: ""We have discovered that under certain conditions, the screen on your iPod nano may become scratched or cracked more easily than we expected.""
The company also offered to send out a free protective case for those who purchased one of the affected devices.
""If you bought an iPod nano from September","has agreed to replace units with a cracked screen free of charge.

Several customers found that the screens of their brand new iPod nano MP3 players were cracking and scratching easily. According to Tyler Hall the creator of http://www.nanoscratch.com, his iPod nano was scratched within 30 minutes of use in the pocket of his shirt. He posted his concerns to the Apple support forums, but his post was deleted. He created www.nanoscratch.com to allow other users to post comments on the iPod’s “scratchability” and post photos of scratched iPods.

""This is a real but minor issue that involved a vendor quality problem in a small number of units,"" said Apple spokesperson Tom Neumayr. Apple estimates that these issues affected less then 0.01% of the total iPod Nanos shipped.

In most individual cases Apple has been telling customers that the scratches and cracks were covered under warranty. Standard warranties on most electronic products do not normally cover cosmetic damage such as scratches or accidental damage such as cracks. Users with a cracked screen can now contact Apple for a free replacement."

The seven - a group of pacifists from various faiths - had been warned before Christmas that they would be prosecuted if they did not pay up by February 28th. They ignored the warning and on Thursday five of them appeared at Hammersmith Magistrates Court in west London charged with failing to pay £354 each. The others failed to appear.
All pleaded guilty and were fined £70 plus costs. Two of the defendants, both","ed to non-military uses, have had their case rejected by a High Court judge.

The judicial review was called for under article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees freedom 'to manifest one's religion or beliefs' and which was made a part of British law in 1998. The Convention includes the right to conscientious objection and the campaigners claim that this gives them the right not to pay other people to go to war on their behalf.

Their statement to the court said: ""We want to make a positive contribution to society by paying our tax in full. We object in conscience to paying others to kill on our behalf, but current tax policy forces us to do just that.""

The courtroom had to be enlarged to make room for supporters and the judge listened to the case for three hours.

Roy Prockter, an accountant and campaign member as well as a Quaker, said that the judge told them that ""our case has no possibility of being resolved in the British courts"".

At about 5pm EDT Tuesday one of Discovery's cockpit window covers became detached and fell sixty feet. The falling cover struck the left Orbital Maneuvering System pod (situated to one side of the tail fin), damaging several thermal protection tiles. The tiles provide vital protection to the Orbiter as it makes its fiery re-entry to Earth's atmosphere.

A replacement panel was fitted in less than an hour, with the only effect being a delay in rolling back the pad's Rotating Service Structure.

This has been the only issue in the build up to today's launch, the first Shuttle flight since the Columbia Orbiter broke up during re-entry in February 2003. All crew were lost in that incident, which has been blamed on damage to a wing thermal protection system panel, caused by a block of fuel tank insulation that became detached and hit the Orbiter during the first moments of flight.

Discovery is due to take off at 3.51pm EDT today. The chance of a weather-related delay to the launch has increased to 40% - due to the possibility of thunderstorms in the area."

The agency's creation was signed into law by President John F. Kennedy on June 30th, 1965. It was abolished in 2008 as part of an energy reform act passed by Congress.
In the early years of its existence, the DEP focused mainly on water quality and air pollution regulation. However, it soon grew to include many other areas such",""" actually refers to state agencies, and in this case refers to the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, not a United States federal agency.

The Cambridge city council adopted a resolution on April 4 to request that the US Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) ""take explicit account"" of the activities of local construction firm W. R. Grace, which has previously contaminated an industrial area near the Alewife train station with asbestos. The council cited Grace's ""extraordinarily extensive and well-documented history of contaminating sites and concealing the contamination"" as the reason for its request.

The resolution was a reaction to a Response Action Outcome Statement and Risk Characterization (RAO) that W. R. Grace filed with the DEP. The Cambridge Chronicle recently took the filing as evidence that ""the state seems poised to stop watching over"" the contaminated site.

In February, W.R. Grace was indicted by a federal grand jury for contamination as a product of vermiculite mining operations in Libby, Montana, USA. The company was also charged with ""concealing information about the health affects sic of its asbestos mining operations."""

According to the ACLU, this is the first time that public school students in the United States have been required to wear devices that enable automatic identification. RFIDs have previously been used to track students in Japan.

RFID tags contain antennas to enable them to receive and respond to radio-frequency queries from an RFID transceiver, enabling identification of pupils when they are in the vicinity of the detectors.

Each student is required to wear an ID card on a lanyard around their neck. An RFID tag, manufactured by local Sutter corporation Incom, is attached to the card. The school has installed RFID detectors at the doors of seven classrooms as well as the bathrooms, though they claim that the bathroom units were not turned on, and subsequently been removed after complaints from parents.

While some parents have complained about the system, local high school teacher Tim Crabtree told the San Francisco Chronicle, ""It's baffling why so many people are bothered by the district being able to tell them where their kids are at,""

A text message, reportedly sent from the doomed aircraft, has also been revealed as a hoax.

Greek Chief Coroner Philippos Koutsaftis stated ""Until now I have done an autopsy on six bodies and first evidence is that when they were killed they had circulation in their heart and lungs.

""That does not mean that they were conscious but that they had breath and circulation. They had circulation and heartbeat so they were alive.""

Initial reports from the Greek Defence Ministry had suggested the bodies were ""frozen solid"" at the moment of impact.

The coroner stressed that as more post mortems were carried out new evidence may come to light.

Nothing is known about the cause of the disaster beyond the fact that everyone on board the airliner was incapacitated at some point, and that emergency oxygen masks had been used. Speculation abounds, with the theory that the airliner failed to maintain pressurisation at some point being the most popular theory.

Helios has said the aircraft was maintained in line with European regulations and had also received a standard inspection before take-off.

Greek police have also arrested a man who claimed his cousin texted him from the airliner, saying the pilots were blue in the face and that they were freezing. He was brought to the district attorney where two charges were filed against him, for lying to the authorities and for spreading false information, and a trial was scheduled. The man claimed that his intention was to gain publicity.

Police have also attended Helios's offices to requisition documents as part of the investigation into the disaster.

The new policy will take effect on June 30, when AP's member-owned cooperative begins to charge an annual subscription fee for online use of its stories.
AP has long charged newspapers and broadcasters for hard copies of its reports, but it had not imposed such fees for electronic distribution until now.

As the Internet draws more news consumers from traditional repositories of data, increasing numbers are demanding the stories on the Internet reflect the quick updating and coverage of a large wire network such as the Associated Press.

The rates the AP charges, known within as “assessments”, have risen by about 2.75 percent annually during the 90’s. Since the service is supposed to be not-for-profit and is owned by its customers, price increases are a tough sell.

The formula for the new calculations still has not been set, making it difficult to determine how the changes will affect what the outlets charge for their online news coverage. Currently the AP bases rates on newspaper circulation or broadcast audience with the large ones footing the major part of the bill.

The doctors did everything they could to save both mother and baby but it wasn't enough. She remained comatose until Monday morning when her doctor decided that there was no hope for her recovery. He then told her family about the pregnancy and asked them whether they wanted to continue with the pregnancy or end it. They opt","on Tuesday. The baby, Susan Anne Catherine Torres, weighs 1 pound, 13 ounces, and is 13 1/2 inches long.

The mother, Susan Torres, had a stroke on May 7 when the condition of her stage four melanoma went to her brain. Doctors said her brain functions had stopped and there was no hope of recovery.

Susan's husband, Jason Torres, asked that his wife be placed on artificial life support until their unborn child had a chance to develop and the baby could survive outside the mother's womb. Mrs. Torres was 17 weeks pregnant on May 7 when she was hospitalized for her condition. The fetus was in its 27th week of development when it was delivered.

The baby reportedly ""is doing well"" and is in intensive care at the Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington County, Virginia. Mr. Torres, who quit his job to be at his wife's side, is faced with thousands in medical expenses.

Rescuers are searching for the victims of the Tans Peru airliner crash which occurred earlier this month. Emergency services rescued ,"12 people from the wreckage but there is no hope that anyone else will be found alive.
The plane was flying from Lima to Puerto Maldonado when it went down in a remote part of the Amazon rainforest on June 30, killing all 14 aboard. The cause of the accident has not been determined and investigators have said they do not believe terrorism or bad weather were involved.

TANS say that 41 people were killed and a further 57 injured in this, the fifth airliner crash worldwide this month. The Boeing 737-200 airliner crash-landed in heavy jungle near the city of Pucallpa, 840 kilometers (522 miles) northeast of Lima, the capital city.

Peruvian authorities have ordered an investigation and have shipped the aircraft's two flight data recorders, or ""black boxes"" to the United States for data retrieval.

Jorge Belevan said ""We've also found five more survivors and that takes the number (of survivors) to 57. Two people are still missing and there are 41 dead,"" Local authorities also said that the death toll is likely to rise due to inaccessible location of the crash site. This is the second TANS Peru plane crash in three years, following the January 2003 crash of flight 222 in the Peruvian rainforest. In that plane crash there were no survivors.

Peruvian government lawyer Marco Ochoa said that rescuers are opening the skin of the aircraft to determine whether there are more bodies trapped inside.

Survivors said that the plane was caught in a fierce storm about 10 minutes before the crash. The plane then caught fire and landed in swampland."

The play was developed as part of an artistic residency program by the National Theatre Network, which brings together artists from different regions of the country to discuss their work with local actors and directors.
In his play, Linhares takes us through the life of the son of God, but this time he does not tell it like a sermon or a story book. He uses humor, dialogue, music, dance and even some special effects to create a funny,","), containing homosexual themes and inspired by the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber.

In the play, Mary, the mother of Jesus is a transexual, Jesus is a punk revolting against the society, Mary Magdalene is a drug dealer, prostitute and homosexual, James is HIV positive and homosexual. The cast includes homosexual and transexual actors.

The plot begins with a 15 years old transexual (Mary) who sees a angel announcing she will conceive the Savior of the World. Later, Jesus begins to do miracles during World War III. Followers go after him. Jesus is charged with anarchism and condemned to death.

Alexandre Linhares, the author, tells how the play idea was born:
:Since I was a child I loved the play Opera-Rock Jesus Christ Superstar. Even my blog is after that name. I loved all the scenes of the film and I always wanted to see the spectacle at Broadway... However, the play that is scheduled to March originated during a time where my life was in a big turmoil, and I decided to post in my blog my idea about creating a play, based in that musical.

The play is scheduled to open March, 18, as part of the Theater Festival of Curitiba."

The inquiry will be headed by former High Court Justice Terence Cole, who is to report within three months on whether Australia's security and intelligence services broke any laws or policies when they passed information about Ms Hicks to US authorities.
It is also expected to look at what role, if any, the Federal Government had in her arrest and detention.
Prime Minister Howard said he was very concerned that she had been held so long without trial.
He also expressed his sympathy with her family.
Ms Hicks' father Terry says his daughter","months and allegedly maltreated by the country's own Immigration Department.

The woman, Cornelia Rau, still insisted she was German Anna Schmidt, according to her sister Christine yesterday. ""I think it will take a long time for her to stabilise,"" she said. ""At the moment she doesn't accept that she is Cornelia and she doesn't want to see us.""

""She is still insisting her name is Anna Schmidt and that her passport is in Baxter and that she wants to return to Germany.""

Refugee advocate Pamela Curr claims Ms Rau was held in isolation for 18 to 20 hours a day in Baxter's 'Red One' isolation facility, where she was allegedly kept in simulated daylight for 24 hours a day.

Her family had only discovered her whereabouts through a refugee-initiated effort to identify the woman, authorities having failed to connect the unidentified detainee with her missing person file, held by New South Wales Police since August last year.

After her family recognised media reports of her on Thursday, and contacted the police, her photo was emailed to the Baxter compound and her identity confirmed.

The schizophrenic woman had spent six months in a Queensland prison, according to Channel Nine News, as well as at least two months in immigration detention, according to various sources. Earlier reports had her being handed over to immigration authorities over 10 months ago, with only five days spent in custody with Queensland Police.

Ms Rau is presently recuperating in hospital."

Mrs Mowlam was born Margaret Diana Roxby-Martin on 14th June 1949. She grew up in Darlington and went to St Aidan's Church of England Comprehensive School before studying English Language at University College London. In 1968 she joined the Labour Party.
She first came to public attention as an organiser of the miners' strike in 1984","in a hospice after a fall two weeks ago. She was 55.

In a statement, prime minister Tony Blair called her ""one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered. She was a natural politician, could read a situation and analyse and assess it as fast as anyone.""

Another former cabinet minister, Clare Short, said: ""She was a very beautiful young woman, she survived ill health and helped bring peace to Northern Ireland and now she's gone far too young.""

Mo Mowlam was central to the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and was popular in Britain for her straightforward approach, informality and honesty.

Ms Mowlam even received a standing ovation during prime minister Blair's speech during the 1998 Labour Party Conference.

Mo Mowlam retired from political life in 2001, but continued to make the headlines by realising her autobiography which was critical of Blair's presidential style of government.

It is thought that the fall that made her go to hospital, and then the hospice where she died, was due to a lack of balance caused by a brain tumour."

The cub is the second to be born in the United States this year. In Washington, Mei Xiang gave birth to a male panda cub at the National Zoo last month after artificial insemination.

According to Hall, early ultrasound images indicated Bai Yun was pregnant with twins. However, zoo personnel became suspicious that one fetus was no longer viable after veterinarians failed to detect a heartbeat in one cub last week. Bai Yun failed to give birth to a second cub Tuesday evening. ""It is likely that the second fetus died in utero and was reabsorbed by her body,"" Hall said.

Józef Rotblat was born on Nov. 4, 1908, in Warsaw, Poland. He grew up in an intellectual household; his father was a doctor and his mother was a teacher of languages. In 1925 he entered the University of Warsaw to study physics, where he met another future scientist, Albert Einstein. The two remained lifelong friends, even after they both emigrated from Europe during World War II.

Born in Poland in 1908, he graduated from Warsaw University.

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palesinian President Mahmoud Abbas today declared an end to military and violent activities against each other,", a development that could lead to the creation of a Palestinian state.
Mr. Abbas said he will ask his government to halt attacks on Israelis in response to Mr. Sharon's decision to suspend all settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for 90 days. The two leaders also agreed to discuss ways to ease economic restrictions imposed by Israel on the Palestinians.
""We have reached a turning point,"" Mr. Abbas told reporters after talks with Mr. Sharon at his official residence in Jerusalem. ""The time has come to put an end to",".

Prime Minister Sharon pledged to end military operations against Palestinians, and President Abbas similarly said that the Palestinians will likewise end ""all acts of violence against Israelis....wherever they are"". Both leaders expressed hope that the agreement will lead to long term peace in the long-running conflict. Prime Minister Sharon said that the agreement is part of the goal of ""quiet, dignified and peaceful lives for all the nations in the Middle East"". President Abbas said ""the calm that is currently prevailing in our territories signals the start of a new era, the start of a hopeful peace."" Both sides also confirmed their intent to create an independent Palestinian state. The talks became possible in the renewed optimism after the death of Yassir Arafat and the election of Abbas.

The agreement marks a profound change in Israeli-Palestinian relations, but the negotiated truce is a shaky peace. The ability of President Abbas to exert control over Palestinian militant groups is questionable, and thorny political issues remain for the Israelis if they begin to withdraw settlers from the occupied territories. There are signs that the Palestinian resistance groups are willing to participate in the cease-fire: the terrorist organisation, HAMAS released a statement in the hours before the summic stating that ""was prepared to calm down resistance raids in the event the Zionist entity reciprocated,"" referring to Sharon's pledge to stop military activities, yet shortly after the summit a spokesman for the organization said it will not be bound by the cease-fire.

The agreement includes a pledge by Israel to release 900 Palestinian prisoners, to create join committees on prisoner release and the withdrawal of troops from Palestinian territories, and cooperation with Palestinian security forces in occupied areas."

Sharon said he would respect the court's decision but added: ""We have no intention of changing our policy.""

Hawi is the third prominent anti-Syrian figure to be assassinated in Lebanon, and the second this month.

Running late and traveling at what survivors thought was excessive speed, it is believed the train lost control at a bend in the track where 71 km/h (44 mph) was the speed limit; however, any speeds under 134 km/h (83 mph) should not have caused derailment.

The train and aircraft disaster research committee, which reports to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, began to research the disaster. The committee members revealed unofficially the physical reasons of the disaster are quite complexe A member of the committee says the speed of train was monitored and at the fifth train it was recoreded that this car had run at 108 km/h speed in a certain moment after emergency brake had worked."

"The state owned telephone monopoly in Costa Rica, the Costa Rica Electricity Institute, (ICE) has called for VoIP Internet to be made","illegal.
The institute is concerned that it will not be able to maintain its current rates if people start making calls using VoIP services such as Skype and Google Talk.
""If we allow this service to exist without a license, then ICE's business would suffer,"" said Jorge Sequeira, head of ICE's public policy department. ""We have no choice but to request the government take action.""
Sequeira also warned that allowing VoIP could lead to an explosion of fraudulent phone calls.
However, the Ministry of Science and Technology disagreed with ICE","a criminal offence. In Costa Rica it has been illegal for anyone other than ICE to offer telephone services. With a reputation for preventing any rivals from challenging its monopoly, but also for providing an efficient service, ICE has recently seen its monopoly dented with as many as 20% of calls being routed through Skype and other VoIP service providers.

On the other hand those who seek to promote the software industry in Costa Rica, which already has a dominant 78% share of the market in Central America and the Caribbean, have reacted by saying the proposal would be disastrous both to software development and the country's ability to outsource work. The ICE claims that its telephone structure is being used by VoIP service providers, which is almost certainly true given that Skype offers calls from the Internet to phones in Costa Rica for 8 US$ cents per minute."

The BBC reported on January 27 that statistics released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health showed that Coalition forces killed 60% of the,"victims in Baghdad, while only 35% were killed by IEDs.
The report also states that a spokesman for the ministry said that ""the US-led coalition has been using more force than is necessary and this is increasing civilian casualties.""
Iraq Body Count reports that there have been 1984 violent deaths in Baghdad since January 1st. Of these, 988 are civilians (including 11 children), 988 are combatants, and 98 are unknown. This brings the total to","civilians that died in the period July 2004 to January 2005.

The figures, normally available only to the Iraqi cabinet, show a total of 3,274 Iraqi civilians were killed and 12,657 wounded during the continuing conflict. These figures exclude the deaths of known insurgents.

However according to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, the BBC misunderstood the matter. According to the previous story from BBC these figures were a result of Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces military operations.

However, the Iraqi Ministry of Health explained that the published figures also include Iraqis killed by terrorists, not only those killed by Coalition forces or Iraqi security forces; and that those recorded as killed in military action included terrorists themselves, and Iraqi security forces.

The BBC recognized their error and apologized in a recent news item, and retracted the conclusions drawn by their original report:

""The BBC regrets mistakes in its published and broadcast reports yesterday,"" reported the BBC.""

The figures, based on records from Iraqi public hospitals released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health, are shown in the following table:

Shortly before the release of the figures by the BBC, US Ambassador John Negroponte had told BBC reporter John Simpson:

""My impression is that the largest amount of civilian casualties definitely is a result of these indiscriminate car bombings."""

This is the last scheduled walk for the Expedition 10 crew.

At 06:25 UTC, the two astronauts left the station from the Pirs DC1 docking compartment/airlock and proceeded to install the last three of six space-to-space communication antennas for the ATV's rendezvous and docking with the ISS next year.

Sharipov next deployed the foot long, 11 pound Russian Nanosatellite, tossing it into space by hand. The object of the experiment is to develop small satellite control techniques, monitor satellite
operations and develop new attitude system sensors. Russian ground crews reported good signal reception from the satellite two hours after its release.

The two astronauts next proceeded to the aft end of the Zvezda service module. A Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna and necessary cabling for the ATV was installed and the men worked their way back to the airlock.

The station maintained its attitude, despite the loss of a gyroscope earlier in the space station mission, until the end of the spacewalk. Chiao and Sharipov reported being a safe distance from the attitude adjustment thrusters. Russian ground control activated the jets and normal attitude of

"Pope John Paul II has been taken to hospital and is suffering from a ""breathing crisis"", the Vatican has confirmed.

The V","atican said that he had suffered an acute breathing problem while celebrating mass in his private chapel on Thursday evening. He was admitted to Gemelli Hospital, Rome's largest Catholic hospital, where doctors are treating him for pneumonia.

His condition deteriorated rapidly overnight and he was transferred to intensive care at 01:30 CET Friday morning (22:30 EDT Thursday) as his blood pressure plummeted. The pope is reportedly being given antibiotics through a vein.

Pope","atican said in a statement that the Pope, 84, is suffering from an acute respiratory infection. He was admitted to the Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital at 2300 local time (2200 UTC).

According to the Vatican the Pontiff is suffering from an acute inflammation of the larynx as well as laryngo-spasms that constrict the lung's intake of air. He was diagnosed with a severe flu three days ago and taken to Gamelli as a precaution.

The Pope is no stranger to Gemelli Polyclinic Hospital. In 1981 he was taken there after being shot in the abdomen by Mehmet Ali Agca and he has been re-admitted at least three times since.

Although the Vatican usually does not comment on the pontiff's state of health, it is widely known that the Pope suffers from Parkinson's disease, and chronic joint problems."

Hon. Parekura Horomia was ranked at number five, the highest ranking of any Maori MP. The Maori MPs face a strong challenge from the newly formed Maori Party. Shane Jones, the highest placed non-MP, is all but assured of a seat in the next Parliament. Steven Ching is placed at 42, and represents Labour's interest in courting the Asian vote. The Asian population has grown significantly over the past ten years within New Zealand.

The surprising absentee is Hon. George Hawkins, the Minister of Police. He has been criticised for performing poorly in the House, and it is speculated he was offered a low ranking and refused. He is likely to return to Parliament on the basis of his strong hold on the Manurewa electorate seat.

Volunteers began a 60 day bed-rest marathon on March 19 to study simulated weightlessness effects on women astronaut,"s. The experiments are being conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas.
The research is part of NASA's long term program for developing space flight medical care and equipment. It will help determine how much gravity affects the female reproductive system.
Astronauts have reported that they experience cramps during their flights. This may be due to changes in blood flow from micro-gravity. Researchers hope to find out whether this effect can be prevented by taking progesterone supplements before or after liftoff.
During the experiment, volunteers lie down","s. The study, Women International Space Simulation for Exploration(WISE), is conducted at the MEDES Space Clinic in Toulouse, France.

The 12 women, selected from 1600 applicants hailing from France,Great Britain, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic began the study after a 20 day screening for baseline comparison data as the study progressed.

The women will conduct all activities from eating, bathing, and reading while lying in hospital beds tilted headfirst at a six degree angle. This particular position, called head-down tilt bed rest was determined from previous studies to remove the vertical load of gravity on the body, inducing changes similar to what astronauts in a genuine weightless environment experience .

Long term exposure to weightlessness creates a number of physiological and psychological problems in astronauts such as:
*Reduced capacity for physical exertion
*Muscle atrophy
*Affects of confinement and isolation
*Impaired circulatory function

A total of 24 women will participate in the study. A second group of 12 will join in September.

Three groups of eight women each will be studied over the course of the two campaigns of bed rest. One group will serve as a control, receiving no specific treatments, the second will exercise, while the third will receive nutritional supplements.

The study is designed to fill in gaps of knowledge on the differences between men and women during extended weightlessness. It also aims to develop countermeasures for reducing the debilitating effects of long spaceflights.

Participating agencies in the study include the European Space Agency, NASA, the French Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency."

The president made the decision to replace Kuroyedov on Thursday, according to RIA-Novosti news agency. The official reasons for his dismissal are not known yet.
Russia's Northern Fleet is currently without a commander as it waits for a new leader to be appointed. The position was previously held by Vice-Admiral Igor Kasatonov who died last year.
Kasatonov had been serving as the fleet’s chief since 2009. He","where 7 Russian sailors became trapped in a submarine, and had to be rescued with help from abroad.

No reason was given for Kuroyedov's dismissal, although Admiral Eduard Baltin speculated on Moscow Radio that it may be because of the navy chief's poor health. According to Reuters, he told Ekho Moskvy: ""He has been lying in hospital for two months, he had a complicated operation.""

Admiral Kuroyedov was in charge of the navy during the Kursk disaster of 2000, in which 118 sailors died when their submarine sank. Kuroyedov is being replaced by Vladimir Masorin, who was previously serving as the Chief of staff for the Russian Navy.

"The European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty on April 13
The President of Romania, Traian Băs","escu, has invited the leaders of all parties in Parliament to a meeting at Cotroceni Palace on Thursday.
According to presidential sources quoted by News In, the purpose of this meeting is to discuss the accession process and the ratification of the EU-Romania Accession Treaty.
""We have an important date ahead: April 13th when we vote for the Accession Treaty,"" said Mr Băsescu, who also added that he would be present at the plenary session of the Parliament on Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, the Prime","escu, met yesterday with Jonathan Scheele, the head of the European Commission's Delegation to Bucharest, as well as with several European parliamentarians (MEPs). The parties discussed Romania's accession to the EU, which is particularly important as the Accession Treaty is scheduled to be signed late this month, after being voted on by the European Parliament on April 13.

Băsescu told the delegation that European integration remains Romania's first priority at the moment, and that after negotiations were closed with the EU in December 2004, accession became a matter of internal politics rather than foreign affairs.

The MEPs talked to Băsescu about public opinion regarding EU accession in Romania, as well as the impact of accession on the rural population. Judging from recent polls, the overwhelming majority of Romania's population approve EU accession, even though this may be partly due to the fact that many of them have not been adequately informed of the costs of accession. The parliamentarians also discussed the environment and the situation in neighbouring countries, especially Moldova. Tourism was also discussed in the context of promoting Romania's image to European Union citizens.

The delegation also discussed with Băsescu a key issue in Romania's accession process: judicial reform. The Romanian President told the MEPs that Romania has taken bold steps to reform its judiciary and fight corruption. There is also progress towards forming an anti-corruption department within the Internal Ministry of Romania.

As part of Romania's foreign policy, Băsescu also said that, once a member of the European Union, Romania would act as an advocate for other Southeastern European states wishing to join the organisation, as well as seeking to attract public attention to the broader Black Sea region. Romania and Bulgariaare the most advanced countries in Southeastern Europe in terms of EU integration, and will therefore be the first countries in this region to join the 25-nation bloc."

The BSE-listed companies include: Romsilva, Electroputere Craiova, Siderurgica Hunedoara, Titan Petrofertil, Vega Bank, Banca Comerciala Carpatica, Banca Agricol","end of next year, the government hopes to sell all of its shares in Romtelecom, Romania's largest telecommunications company, which is currently owned by Greece's OTE but which the government maintains a 47% share in. The full privatisation will occur in two phases, with some of the government's existing shares being sold on the Bucharest Stock Exchange this year, and the remainder being sold in 2006.

By 2006, the government also wants to sell its share in Postelecom, another telecommunications operator, and complete the privatisation of the Radiocomunicaţii, the national radio communications company.

The Government also wantes to begin analysis and consulting into the privatisation of Poşta Română, or Romanian Post, the full privatisation of which is set to be completed by 2009 at the latest.

Romania has embarked on a quite comprehensive program of privatisation since 2000, having privatised a part of Romtelecom, as well as full privatisations of several energy distributors and the nation's largest banks, in addition to other smaller companies. However, these privatisations are dwarfed by that of Petrom, Romania's national oil company, which was bought by Austria's OMV in 2004 and is the largest Romanian privatisation ever.

The current Liberal-Democrat governing coalition in Romania has privatisation and economic liberalism as one of its main policies, having also introduced a 16% flat tax rate for personal income and corporate profits at the start of 2005."

The Coalition of University Employees accuses top UC officials of ignoring the union's requests regarding the high turnover rate of researchers. CUE organizers say the university is misleading the union about the quantity of money readily available for employee salary increases.

The UC officials deny accusations that they have bargained in bad faith, saying they have offered a contract to the researchers that's similar to an approved deal.

Those living there for less than five years will receive half that amount. In addition, those who owned their homes prior to May 2001, when Ariel Sharon became Prime Minister, will receive an additional NIS 30,","from the Gaza Strip.

Samsung announced it will market DVD players capable of playing back both Sony's Blu-Ray and Toshiba's HD DVD next,"year.
Samsung, the world's biggest maker of TV sets, said its new models would be available in Europe from March 2007. It did not give details on price or specifications.
""We are working closely with all parties involved to develop a product that is compatible with both formats,"" a spokesman for Samsung Electronics told Reuters.
Toshiba has been pushing hard to promote its format as an alternative to Blu-ray, which was launched earlier this year by a group led by Sony Corp., Microsoft and Intel.
HD DVD uses blue lasers","-generation optical storage formats, if the two camps refuse to compromise on a single format. Assuming development is successful, consumers could expect to see such a device on store shelves next year.

Blu-Ray and HD DVD are projected to be the successor formats for current DVDs. Samsung, while leaning towards the Blu-Ray camp, hopes it can cover both bases by distributing a player with dual-compatibility. While this means spending more in development to unify the two technologies and develop a cost-effective production method, dual compatibility may pay off for the company if the formats challenge each other as VHS and Betamax did twenty-five years ago. Despite the support for Blu-Ray, Samsung has also been supportive of a unified standard to avoid such costly competition.

HD DVD offers single layer capacity of 15GB, more than triple the size of standard single layer DVDs, and benefits from similarities with current DVDs, such as cheap production and compatibility with current DVD players. Blu-Ray can hold 23GB on its smallest single layer version, and is reported to have superior durability and interactivity over current DVD-based technology and HD-DVD. HD-DVD is currently promoted by Toshiba, NEC, Sanyo and Microsoft; while Blu-Ray's base of support is the Blu-Ray Disc Association, which is led by Blu-Ray developers Sony and Philips. It is notable that Sony and Philips, who developed the Blu-Ray format, also competed against the Toshiba-designed SuperDisc DVD standard, which is the standard that is followed today.

The first Blu-Ray and HD DVD products are expected to start appearing in mainstream markets within the next year."

Palkin also confirmed that the price tag for each player is €5 million. The official signing ceremony is scheduled for 10 am today in Moscow.
The transfer fee was agreed upon by the clubs during negotiations held last week in Lisbon.
""We are satisfied with this deal as it allows us to strengthen our squad,"" Palkin added.",". Their transfer cost was 16 and 4 million euros respectively, making this the most expensive transfer deal in Russian football. The head of Dinamo's board of directors, Alexey Fedorychev, is among the wealthiest Russian businessmen and he is responsible for making the money available to the club. Another Dinamo transfer target is the Greek footballer Seitaridis, also playing for Porto, but this deal has not yet been confirmed.

Meanwhile, in a Russian Premier League match Saturday with Amkar Perm Dinamo Moscow suffered its fourth defeat in a row 1-2, dropping to 9th place. Amkar (one of the poorest teams in Premier League) on the other hand, won the second match in a row. Despite conceding an early goal, Amkar was able to fight back, score from a penalty and secure a slender lead to win the away game.

Despite numerous signings between seasons and hiring a new coach, Oleg Romantsev, Dinamo's performance is far from the best. Last season saw them at 14th place (out of 16), barely avoiding relegation, and the start of a new season isn't promising either. It is yet to be seen, whether the new signings can help the club join the ranks of the top RPL teams, such as Lokomotiv Moscow and CSKA Moscow."
"Irish low fares airline, Ryanair, this week celebrated its 20th birthday. Having reached the milestone, the airline prompt","ly launched a new route from Stansted to Porto in Portugal.
The carrier has been expanding rapidly over the past few years and now flies to more than 150 European cities from nine UK bases. It is also one of the fastest growing airlines in Europe with passenger numbers increasing by 36% last year alone.
Ryanair's founder and CEO, Michael O'Leary, said: ""We are delighted that we have just completed our 20th anniversary year, during which time we have grown from two aircraft to 178, carried 49","ly used the opportunity, as always, to sell seats; launching a massive 200,000 seat sale at 99p/99c a seat.

The airline was founded in 1985 by the Irish businessman, Dr Tony Ryan. It began its existence flying a small 15 seat aircraft between Waterford and London Gatwick with the small aim of breaking the duopoly on London-Ireland flights, held at that time by British Airways and Aer Lingus. Today however, the airline now flies to over 200 European destinations with its fleet of 84 Boeing 737's and is awaiting the arrival of a future 225 aircraft from Boeing.

The company today carries as much as 3m passengers a month (depending on the season) and has revealed it made a profit of €245m (USD$307,916,000) in the past year. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated that the airline will carry over 70m passengers annually within five years. The notoriously eccentric Mullingar man went on to tell the press ""The very fact that a Mickey Mouse Irish airline can start in a field in Waterford 20 years ago and in 20 years overtake the world's self-styled, self proclaimed favourite airline is testament to the almost unstoppable demand for low airfare travel around Europe.""

To demonstrate the huge drop in airfares over the last year, the company claimed while the price of a Ryanair seat had dropped from £99.99 in 1985 to 99p today, the price of a pint of beer had trebled and the average house price in England had increased by 500%."
"Venezuela recognized that the mother of Ugueth Urbina, Maura Josefina Villareal, was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces","of Colombia (Farc), who asked for a ransom.
Urbina is currently in custody in Miami awaiting extradition to Venezuela on charges of money laundering and embezzlement.
The Ministry of People's Power for Interior Affairs reported that the FARC contacted the Colombian government through its ambassador in Caracas, asking to talk with the relatives of Urbina.
""After several conversations between the two delegations, it was agreed to establish direct communication between the families,"" said the statement from the ministry.
It added that ""in compliance","of Colombia (FARC-EP) commander Alvis Patiño, known as El Chiguiro. Urbina is a Venezuelan and a Major League Baseball right-handed closer who plays for the Detroit Tigers.

Chiguiro has been captured on February 2005. A delegation of authorities from Colombia was sent to Venezuela, so he could be identified. Now, after his identification, Colombian officers expects he can be extradicted to Colombia. In Colombia, Chiguiro is expected to be judged for the alleged crimes of kidnapping and murderer of the American missionaries Sthephen Everet and Thimoty Dike in 1995.

Some Venezuelan baseball players from the Major Leagues said that kidnapping is a new situation they must learn to live with. None of them said that the risk of kidnappings would prevent their return to Venezuela.

For years, Venezuelan cattlemen near Colombian borders say that they are victims of extorsion by FARC forces. This is the first time that the Venezuelan government recognizes that the FARC is responsible by this kind of crime in Venezuela.

According to the Colombian authorities, Chiguiro is envolved with the exchange of drugs by weapons with Brazilian traffic drug dealers."
Pope John Paul II has been re-admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital with a relapse of influenza which saw him hospitalised earlier,"in the week.
The 82-year-old pontiff was taken ill on Thursday and admitted to the hospital, where he remained until Saturday evening when he was transferred back to his papal summer residence at Castelgandolfo near Rome.
Pope John Paul II is expected to be released from the hospital today after doctors have given him the all clear.
Hospital spokesman Mario Angelini said: ""He will probably leave this morning.""
Asked how long it would take for the pope to make a full recovery, Mr Angelini replied: ""It depends on what","this month.

He was wheeled into Gemelli Hospital on a partially elevated stretcher, and was waving to people as he entered the clinic.

Later, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls announced that the pope had undergone a tracheotomy to assist his breathing.

The Pope's re-admittance again raises questions about how long his papacy will last. One of his close aides refused to rule out the possibility of the Pope retiring saying it was up to his ""conscience"". The Pope has recently indicated that he has no intention of retiring by saying that the call ""to guard his flock"" was ""particularly alive in him"".

The operation lasted around thirty minutes, and Navarro Valls said to media that it was a success."

In a scene repeated across much of America, each morning a group of day laborers, mostly immigrants, assemble by a 7-Eleven convenience store in the hopes of getting work.

Each day, nearly 200 people gather near the nation's capital in Herndon, Virginia; these laborers do much of the hard and dangerous work not wanted by most U.S. citizens. This daily gathering has drawn both the ire and compassion of the Herndon community. A public hearing Monday night to discuss a new plan drew an overflowing crowd to the Town Council chambers. The Commission said so many people signed up to speak at the hearing that the panel will need to convene again Tuesday night.

For years groups and businesses among the community who want to help the day laborers have been working on the issue. In a plan spearheaded by Bill Threlkeld, of the group Project Hope and Harmony, they lobbied Herndon officials to use taxpayer money to build a regulated day laborer center in an old police station at the edge of town. This they say would get the day-laborer group(s) off the street. The plan has the backing of Herndon mayor, Michael L. O'Reilly.

The plan would also combine the opening of the center with a new local ordinance that would make it a misdemeanor crime for a laborer to seek work at any location other than the official one. Opponents of the plan say the town would be aiding illegal immigrants if it established the center.

A Pew Hispanic Center survey found a 25% increase over four years in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The number now is estimated to have reached about 10.3 million. Local governments do not have the authority to enforce national immigration laws, so the town of Herndon must rely on federal officials, who show little interest in getting involved."
Helsingin Sanomat reports images circulating over the Internet that purport to show male conscripts being sexually abused and humiliated,"by female officers in a Finnish military facility.
The newspaper has not confirmed the veracity of the photos, which were taken at an army base in Kuopio, eastern Finland, last weekend. The photographer who took them told Helsingin Sanomat they had been passed on to him by a source he did not want to identify.

In the images, released through Internet forums, soldiers are humiliated by their officers, being forced to act like dogs with other soliders holding their leashes. The Defence Forces communications director Ossi Kervinen considers the matter unfortunate.

The images are strikingly similar to those that came out of the Abu Ghraib prison last year.

Finland has a policy of neutrality, with a requirement of conscription for all men between the ages of 18-30 for 180 to 362 days. However, they can opt to do civil service work instead, which lasts 13 months."
U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema accepted would-be hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui's guilty pleas on,"terrorism conspiracy charges but refused to dismiss the death penalty as a possible punishment for his crimes.
Moussaoui, who has been held since August 2001 in solitary confinement at the Alexandria jail, told the court that he was willing to die if it meant preventing more attacks like those of September 11.
""I am ready to be executed,"" said Moussaoui, speaking through an Arabic translator. ""If I can save one life by my death, then I will accept this.""
But the judge rejected his request to throw","six charges of conspiracy laid against him for his plotting to participate in the Sept. 11 attacks. Moussaoui, who had to be restrained at one point during the trial in an Alexandria, Virginia courthouse, was polite and quiet during the day's appearance.

36-year-old Moussaoui, a French citizen, faces the death penalty or life in prison in the sentencing phase of his trial. The prosecution has also asked that Moussaoui be forced to pay restitution to the victims of the attack.

19 hijackers took control of four planes on September 11, 2001. Nearly four weeks before the attack, Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota on immigrations charges having raised the suspicions of instructors at a flight school.

During the attack, two planes were flown into the World Trade Center buildings, a third struck the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, USA."
"European aircraft manufacturer, Airbus, has won an order from Qatar Airways for up to 60 of its new mid-sized A","321XLR aircraft. The deal is valued at US$5.1 billion (€4.7 billion) and will be the largest ever single-aisle jetliner order in history.
The agreement was signed during a visit by HH Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, to France on June 18th. It also comes as part of a longstanding relationship between both companies that stretches back more than two decades.
Qatar Airways currently operates 19 Airbus aircraft including five A350s","350 jets. The order, which is believed to be worth $15 billion, has given a boost to an otherwise disappointing Paris Air Show, which had been dominated by a state aid dispute between Airbus and Boeing.

Qatar Airways, which choose the Airbus A350 over Boeing's 787, will also purchase 20 of Boeing's larger 777 planes for $4.6 billion. Qatar has a previous order for 2 of Airbus' massive new A380's which it will begin to fly in 2009 out of London Heathrow.

In 2004, Airbus sold more planes than Boeing for the first time ever, sparking questions whether the US company had lost its once seemingly impregnable grip on the aviation market. However thus far, Boeing has received far more orders than Airbus in 2005."
"The Italian government has criticized the Swedish public service broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT) for their recently launched campaign called ""Fri Television"". One","of the main arguments is that it's a violation of the European Union's competition rules.
The SVT-campaign started on March 1, and will last until May 30. It includes TV commercials with the slogan ""Fri television - pay less"", where they try to attract new subscribers by lowering the price from SEK 295 ($47) per month to SEK 265 ($40). The commercial shows people doing funny things in order to save money, like walking naked through town or going without underwear.

The music theme of the campaign is a Mandolin version of the popular Italian song ""O' sole mio"".

The Italian government has said that this is a matter for Italy. Telecom minister Maurizio Gasparri said that the information is false. The Swedish ambassador in Italy, Staffan Wrigstad, was yesterday called to the Italian ministry of foreign affairs.

The CEO of SVT, Christina Jutterström, says that she doesn't have plans to stop the campaign. ""This campaign is like Italian shoes. It's pointed and a bit uncomfortable"", Jutterström said to the Swedish news program Rapport."
"In New York, speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative, British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke with ""brutal honesty"" about the","Iraq war and his role in it. He said that he had not done a good job of selling the case for the invasion to the public, but that he did what he thought was necessary to protect Britain from Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction.
Blair also defended his decision to commit troops to Afghanistan, saying that the country is now on the path to being a democracy.
He also criticized President Bush for failing to take more action against Iran over its nuclear program.

"As they have done for the last four years, United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientists were measuring an approximate 100 square","-mile area of the earthquake fault in southern California. The team was doing this to measure how much strain is building up on the San Andreas Fault system as a result of the recent magnitude 7.8 earthquake that hit Mexico and the subsequent aftershocks.
The USGS has been using GPS technology since 2009 to track movement along the San Andreas Fault System. This time period includes the Mw 7.2 Haiti Earthquake, the Mw 6.3 Virginia Earthquake, the Mw 5.8 New York City Earthqu","mile bulge in central Oregon near the South Sister this past August. The bulge is located 25 miles outside of the city of Bend, Ore. and three miles from the South Sister.

The results of this years survey won't be available for some weeks, but geologists have come to some conclusions based on the past four years of monitoring. The intial discovery was made by using information from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Interferometric Satellite Aperture Radar satellite. Scientists believe the bulge is rising at a rate of 1.4 inches per year and is due to a large lake of fluid (likely magma) that is 4.5 miles below the surface. They also think the fluid covers an area about one mile across and extends to a depth of 65 feet. The pooling fluid could be shifting magma or the creation of a new volcano.

Ground swells aren't an extraodinary occurrence in geology. Geologists suspect that these ground swellings occur in the Cascade Range and at other volcanoes, and the majority of them do not lead to eruptions. Using the same ESA satellite technology, geologists have seen lots of bulges in the Aleutian Islands that have not lead to eruptions."

The carrier currently operates one flight a day on this route using an Airbus A319 aircraft, however it is now planning to increase capacity and frequency for summer 2018.
TAROM said in a statement: “With the new schedule, we are able to offer our passengers more comfortable conditions during their journey.”
The company added that it had also taken delivery of two new Embraer E190-E2 jets which have been introduced into service on routes between Cluj Napoca and Vienna, as","arest, the Romanian capital, to Arad, a city in the country's west, will be cancelled, due to lack of financial viability and an increase in competition. The reason for the cancellation is mainly due to the planned inauguration on May 16 of a Bucharest-Arad flight operated by the private airline Carpatair, Romania's second-largest airline.

Carpatair has grown very quicly in the past two years, adding several new destinations, both in Romania and abroad. Also, it has taken away many of TAROM's customers on international routes because it provides direct connections from Transylvanian cities such as Arad and Timişoara to German and Italian cities, saving customers the task of changing flights at Bucharest. Also, although Carpatair started out as a Transylvanian airline, it now also flies to destinations in Romania's east, and is expected to open up new routes via Bucharest, in a further attempt to compete with TAROM and win more market share.

In 2004, TAROM was Romania's largest airline, carrying approximately 940,000 passengers. Carpatair came in at second, carrying approximately 271,000 passengers."

The first trial ended in a mistrial after one juror received a threatening letter. Nancy Salomon says of the second trial that the ""Defense was counting on the jury not reaching a verdict; they had used their challenges during the jury selection process to kick almost every potential juror who had a college degree, or had any business experience or Wall Street experience off the jury ... they were hoping that this case was just going to be too confusing for the jury."" While the jury did take 11 days to arrive at their decision, they found Kozlowski and Swartz guilty on 22 of the 23 counts. To combat the aggressive jury selection strategy undertaken by the defense, the prosecution ""basically gave the jury several credit hours worth of an MBA"", teaching them about following paper trails and detecting falsification of business records. It paid off during deliberation as the jury requested over 100 documents to review.

Kozlowski and Swartz directly stole approximately $150 million USD from Tyco and acquired $430 million more by inflating the company's stock value and then secretly selling company shares.

At Thursday’s keynote presentation of the Tokyo Game Show, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata unveiled the controller design for its next-generation Wii successor. The new controller is a departure from the Wiimote and nunchuk controllers that have been used since 2006 with the original Wii system.
The new controller will be wireless, but it won’t require any external communication equipment to function. It also has an accelerometer built into the device itself, which allows players to control their actions by tilting","for the company's new Nintendo Revolution console. Resembling a television remote, the controller uses two sensors placed near the user's television to triangulate its position in three-dimensional space. This will allow players to control actions and movements in video games by moving the device through the air.

The remote control design is said to target new players who are unfamiliar with traditional video game controllers.

A supplementary peripheral has also been shown, consisting of a separate plastic grip that is designed to be held in the player's second hand. It provides an analog stick and two trigger buttons, and connects to the bottom of the main controller with a simple cord. Additionally, Nintendo has suggested that the main controller will be able to slide inside a ""shell"" that will allow it to function like a conventional video game controller.

The Revolution is expected to be released next year.

A World Health Organization (WHO) committee comprising of 43 African health ministers has declared a tuberculosis emergency on the,"continent.
The decision came after an assessment by the WHO that TB is one of the biggest public health threats in Africa, killing more than 100,000 people per year and accounting for 25 percent of deaths from infectious diseases.
Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria called mycobacterium tuberculosis which typically affect the lungs but can spread to other parts of the body such as the brain, kidneys or spine. It is transmitted through air when someone coughs, sneezes or talks","continent.

The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in African countries per year has quadrupled since 1990, and continues to rise. Now 540,000 people die of the disease in Africa every year.

Worldwide, TB kills two million people a year; the only deadlier disease in the world is HIV/AIDS.

Some African countries such as Tanzania and Malawi pioneered TB control strategies that were later adopted around the globe. But they were not successful - Malawi saw the number of TB cases a year rise by four times over the past 15 years. Poverty, poor health systems and HIV have been blamed by the WHO for this.

Funding is a particularly critical issue. Eight of the nine worst affected African countries reported that, for 2003, they had short-falls in the funding their TB control programmes needed. However the WHO stresses that money alone will not end the crisis - health systems must be improved, and the rate at which health professionals are lost in the region must be reduced.

Africa is the only region in the world to be experiencing an increase in TB cases - in the rest of the world, infection rates are either stable or falling."

Another Palestinian man is in a critical condition after being shot in the chest. The man, from the Rafah refugee camp, was shot near the Israeli settlement of Atzmona. The Israeli army, which has a garrison in Atzmona, is looking into the incident.

Meanwhile, Ramallah has accused Lebanese rebel group Hezbollah of attempting to sabotage the fragile peace agreement in the Middle East. The group, backed by Syria and Iran, are attempting to recruit Palestinian militants to engage in attacks of Israeli targets, claim Palestinian spokesmen. The charges mirror those made recently by Israel, which has long accused Hezbollah of bankrolling Palestinian violence in the region.

Hezbollah denies the charges, and claims to be honouring the ceasefire agreed yesterday. However, Palestinian officials claim to have intercepted bank records and email communications that prove that the guerilla group is recruiting militants in the West Bank. Abbas is shying away from any confrontation with the group at the moment, but has sent an envoy to Beirut to persuade Hezbollah to desist from its aggressive activities.

Despite the setbacks, Israel has begun to lift restrictions of travel and issue permits to 1000 Palestinians to work in Israel, as part of Tuesday's deal. Sharon has agreed to travel to Ramallah to continue talks toward peace in the region."
Helen Clark (Prime Minister) and Don Brash (Leader of the Opposition) have gone head-to-head in the first,"televised leaders debate.
The hour long programme was hosted by TVNZ's John Campbell, who asked both politicians a wide range of questions on subjects from education to taxation.
Mrs Clark told Mr Brash she had been ""a strong advocate for public service"" during her time as Prime Minister, while he said his policies would lead to lower taxes.
He also criticised Labour's policy of putting more police officers on the streets.
Mr Brash said it was not possible to increase police numbers because there were only so many criminals around.
But Mrs Clark said crime rates had fallen","live televised debate between the two leaders in the New Zealand general election of 2005.

A studio audience contained equal numbers of National and Labour Party supporters.

The debate ran through tax, race relations, foreign affairs, immigration, education and health (all the key policy areas).

Taxes were at the top of the agenda; the debate was just hours after the National Party released their tax policy.

Don Brash said that the nuclear freeze policy of New Zealand (which bans nuclear powered US warships from its ports) and Helen Clark's criticism of the war in Iraq have both contributed to her failure to secure a free-trade pact with the United States.

Helen Clark was confident and aggressive and she often forced Don Brash into defensive explanations of National's policies."
"New mass grave was discovered in a cave in Klina region, Kosovo. According to UNMIK's report, the remains are probably of non","-Albanian victims from 1998 and 1999.

Al-Zawahri also warned other nations to leave Muslim lands to avoid further violence. He was quoted as saying: ""What you have seen, O Americans, in New York and Washington and the losses you are having in Afghanistan and Iraq, in spite of all the media blackout, are only the losses of the initial clashes, If you continue the same policy of aggression against Muslims, God willing, you will see the horror that will make you forget what you had seen in Vietnam.""

A 20-year-old man from New Zealand was arrested by police on suspicion of DUI after he drove through a red light at high speed, nearly causing an accident with another car. The officer who stopped him claimed that the suspect had bloodshot eyes and smelled strongly of alcohol. He also reportedly staggered when asked to walk a line.
The arresting officer decided to perform a field sobriety test. But before doing so, the officer told the suspect that if he refused the breathalyzer test, he would be charged with refusal. The suspect then made","zer.

The man was arrested Sunday by South Simcoe Police after his pickup truck was pulled over on Ontario Provincial Highway 11 in Stroud, Ontario, Canada.

"Guidant Corporation recently announced another safety warning on several models of its implantable defibrillators, cautioning users for the second time in","two years about a potentially deadly battery failure.
The company has received 12 reports of batteries that failed while patients were receiving shocks to treat cardiac arrhythmias. No deaths have been reported as a result of these failures, but one patient suffered serious heart damage and required open-heart surgery. The device is designed to send electrical pulses through wires embedded in the heart to correct abnormal rhythms.
Guidant first warned about this problem last year after it received five reports of similar incidents. In both cases, the devices are equipped with l","a week about the devices. No patients are known to have been injured by the devices at this time. This brings the total number of defibrillator models recalled to twelve.

According to the Associated Press article, the five defibrillator models recalled ""have a magnetic switch that can become stuck in a closed position, preventing the device from treating irregular heart rhythms. The faulty switch also can limit a defibrillator's battery life.""

American manufacturing giant Proctor &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) plans to acquire Gillette Co. for US$5,"7 billion, a deal that will create the world's biggest maker of household products and raise P&amp;G's stake in the male-grooming business from 40% to more than 60%.
The combination would put P&amp;G in direct competition with Unilever NV, which bought Alberto Culver Inc. last year for about $3.7 billion. It also would give P&amp;G an even stronger position against rival consumer goods company Colgate-Palmolive Co., which owns Softsoap and other brands.
""We","7 billion in stock. The purchase plan calls for P&amp;G to swap 0.975 shares of its stock per share of Gillete Co. P&amp;G also announced a stock buyback program in which they would purchase up to US$22 billion of shares over the next 18 months. Including the stock buyback program, the merger is being financed by 60 percent stock and 40 percent cash.

P&amp;G is known for brands such as Ariel and Tide washing powder, Max Factor cosmetics, Pringles potato crisps (chips) and Hugo Boss and Lacoste perfumes.

Gillette, known for brands such as Gillette razors, Oral B dental care, and Duracell batteries, has had growing problems with the growth of private labels and price cuts demanded by large supermarkets.

After the acquisition is completed, Gillette's CEO James Kilts will be P&amp;G's vice-chairman. Kilts said that he expects that this acquisition will cause additional mergers to take place.

""I believe the consumer product industry needs to consolidate,"" said Kilts, ""we believe we can bring these companies together and create a juggernaut.""

P&amp;G and Gillette have a combined market capitalization of about $185 billion US, which will make it the largest in the sector.

The early morning announcement states that 6,000 employees will be eliminated. Most of the layoffs will result from reducing overlapping management positions and other supporting positions within the combined company.

Antitrust regulators in the US and Europe plan to review the acquisition, to determine whether the combined company will have too much power over pricing and shelf space.

P&amp;G plans to provide additional details about the merger Friday morning (East Coast time) in New York."
Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was officially placed under house arrest a day after the country's Supreme Court upheld his,"30-month prison term for tax fraud.
Pinochet, who has been hospitalised since suffering a heart attack in March, is confined to his home and must wear an electronic tag that monitors his location at all times. He will be allowed out of the house only to receive medical treatment or attend official events.
The decision came as hundreds of people marched through Santiago on Thursday calling for Pinochet's prosecution over human rights violations during his rule from 1973 to 1990. The protesters also want former President Salvador Allende","indictment of one count of murder and nine counts of kidnapping.

Court officials say the arrest order was delivered to Gen. Pinochet's home near the capital, Santiago, Wednesday. The 89-year-old retired general has been at his home recovering from a stroke he suffered in late December.

A government commission, the Rettig Commission, listed 2,095 deaths and 1,102 disappearances during his 17-year rule. In 2004 the Valech Report that was issued after interviewing an estimated 35,000 people who claimed to have been abused by the regime; 28,000 were regarded legitimate.

The crimes were allegedly committed as part of Operation Condor, a campaign of assassination and terrorization meant to suppress left-wing opposition to Pinochet's regime. The Chilean-led program soon spread to other military regimes throughout Latin America, and may have had at least tacit complicity by then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The Pinochet dictatorship ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990, gaining power after a military coup overthrew the democratically-elected socialist President Salvador Allende."

He had her move to his home town of Potsdam where he built her a mansion and provided for her until she died in 1925.

Artistic director Bernhard Glocksin says that the theatre is claiming the metaphorical ""artistic licence"", to excuse the actions of the actors and audience, which are against German law. Glocksin was quoted by Ananova as saying opera would be ""improved with a few joints and some appetising lines"", noting the production was partly an experiment, to see what they could ""get away with.""

""Artistic licence"" is at par to an ""artistic liberty"", where something is exaggerated or changed for the sake of the art itself.

"The new leader of Togo, the late president Gnassingbé Eyadéma's son, Faure Gnassingb","é, has been inaugurated in Lome.
The 35-year-old took over from his father who died last month aged 69 after ruling for more than three decades.
He is Africa's youngest head of state and will rule until elections are held next year.
Hundreds of people have protested against Mr Gnassingbé, saying he does not deserve to lead the country.
They accuse him of being a puppet of France, which backed his candidacy.
""Today we must start a new page,"" said Mr Gn","é, pledged to hold ""free and transparent elections which reflect the will of the people"" as soon as possible, though he did not mention a specific timeframe, nor did he address international criticism of his ascession to power.

Togolese politics have become a subject of criticism by the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations after the death of Eyadéma late last week. Eyadéma was Africa's longest-ruling leader whose 38-year rule was marked by government-sponsored violence and the stifling of political expression.

The Constitution of Togo was amended to permit Eyadéma to retain power, to allow more than two five-year terms in office, and to lower the minimum age for a president from 45 to 35. The latter move was seen as a way to allow the succession of the presidency to Eyadéma's son, then only 35 years old.

When Eyadéma died on Saturday of a heart attack, the country's Constitution called for power to be transferred to the head of the national assembly. Instead, Faure Gnassingbé assumed power and the Constitution was amended to allow this, causing criticism from foreign commentators.

Faure Gnassingbé also promised reforms, and an open dialog with the opposition parties. However, with the opposition leader out of the country since an assassination attempt in 1992, and the presidential term not set to expire until 2008, it is not clear how much change these promises will bring in the near future."

Luigi R. Einaudi, the former Assistant Secretary General, is serving as Acting Secretary General until the OAS decides who will serve for the remainder of the current term of office.

Before Menchú was nominated, the Central American states had decided that the candidate should be from Central America. But the Rodriguez scandal has made it difficult for the Central American states to find another candidate they could all endorse.

Chile and Mexico have proposed their own candidate for the job.

President Oscar Berger of Guatemala agrees that Menchú should be the Central American candidate. Menchú has said that if the Central American nations are in agreement, she will happily stand as their candidate.

An indigenous Guatemalan, Menchú won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, and was also prominent in her opposition to the previous FRG government which Berger defeated.

There are 10,000 courts across the country, and they are expected to take eight years to process all accused. Regular courts would have taken up to 100 years. The judges are untrained citizens elected by their peers.

The 1994 Rwandan genocide was an eruption of ethnic conflict where Hutu militia, supported by the Hutu dominated government and encouraged by 'hate radio', attempted to ethnically cleanse the minority Tutsi. Despite numerous warnings the international community did not take serious action to prevent the atrocities, which included hacking people to death with machetes, and forcing people into buildings that were then destroyed with bulldozers. Estimates place the number killed at up to one million."
The US Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah is looking for a subcontractor to produce the anthrax bacill,"us, according to an open contracting notice.
Dugway has awarded a $20m (£13.4m) contract to Science Applications International Corporation to carry out research and development on ""anthrax as a biological agent"". The work will be conducted at the company's facility in Fort Detrick, Maryland.
The contract also requires SAIC to develop methods of growing large amounts of the anthrax bacillus, which can cause disease in humans and livestock. It must be grown under controlled conditions so that it does not become infected with other organisms such as vir","us anthracis Sterne strain in 1,500 litre quantities. The Sterne strain is not thought to be harmful to humans, but the intended use of the anthrax remains unclear, worrying anti-biological weapons activists. Other recent Dugway contracts for equipment to produce unspecified biolgical agents in 3,000 litre batches are even more concerning to activists.

The contracts were uncovered by The Sunshine Project, a group opposed to biological weapons development based in Germany. The work involved seems to cast doubts on the ability of the US to live up to its commitments to the Biological Weapons Convention. The post 9/11 anthrax attack upon the U.S. used weaponized U.S. Army anthrax , most likely produced at Fort Detrick.

A Dugway spokesperson declined to specify what the biological agents would be used for."
"A month after the Cook County Board of Commissioners unanimously voted to welcome the 2006 Gay Games to Chicago, the five Republicans","on the board have filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the county's decision.
The suit claims that the commissioners did not follow state laws when they approved the games and says that the vote was taken ""arbitrarily"" without public debate or consideration of alternative venues for the event. The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the resolution void.
Commissioner John Daley (D-11th), who sponsored the resolution, said he is confident it will be upheld by the courts. He also noted that the Republican commissioners had ample opportunity to voice their concerns","on the board withdrew their names under pressure from conservative activists. Chicago is located in Cook County.

The Gay Games is an Olympics-style multi-day international sports competition targeted to LGBT athletes.

Commissioners Gregg Goslin, Liz Gorman, Carl Hansen, Tony Peraica and Peter Silvestri, the only Republicans sitting on the Board of Commissioners withdrew their names from the proclamation. ""I'm a pro-family kind of person and conservative on social issues. That's nothing against the gay and lesbian community, but it's nothing I want to advance as a cause celebre,"" Peraica told the Chicago Sun-Times. In the same report, Gorman said that she doesn't support ""special rights for any group.""

An anti-gay rights lobbying group, the Illinois Family Institute (IFI), says it is trying to get Democrat commissioners to also withdraw their names from the official welcome. ""There is a difference between tolerating and celebrating homosexuality,"" Peter LaBarera, a spokesman for the group said in an Associated Press interview. The IFI also expressed concern about taxpayer money being used to promote the event.

Although Gay Games spokeswoman Tracy Baim she said she was not surprised by the reversal of the five commissioners, Mike Quigley, a Democrat Cook County Commissioner said of the retraction of his colleagues, ""It's a blinding bias and animosity that is overriding human interest, job creation, economic development and the whole spirit of athletic competition."" Quigley was the sponsor of the proclamation and plans to play ice hockey in the games.

The next round of elections are scheduled for the end of October although it is widely believed this date is unlikely to be met.

The peace process in Cote d'Ivoire has been on shaky ground following the failure of the rebel forces to begin the disarmament process originally scheduled for 31 July.

Canadian military officials are being accused of covering up the use of the deadly chemical agent Agent Orange and other defoliants during the 1950,"s in Canada.
The allegations came from a report by the Ottawa-based group, The National Committee on Hidden Military Pollution (NCOHMP).
According to NCOHMP, the government has known about the presence of these chemicals since at least the early 1980s but never publicized it.

At a public meeting attended by at least 200 people, defence officials said only a small amount of the herbicide was used, over a total of seven days between 1966 and 1967 at the army base to clear foliage to prevent fires during artillery training and to clear the view for soldiers.

The American military was also given permission by the Canadian military to test Agent Orange, Agent Purple, and Agent White during the Vietnam War on less than 500 acres of the Canadian base.

Thursday’s public meeting followed in the aftermath of recent media reports that a U.S. army report indicated the use of Agent Purple, which is considered three-times more toxic than Agent Orange, as part of the spraying program.

When revelations about the use of Agent Purple first surfaced in mid-June, retired sergeant, Earl Graves, said, “They were out in the exercise area and the planes flew over spraying and they were told to just put ponchos over their head, that it wouldn’t hurt them.”

He said 170 soldiers in his regiment died of cancer and many of them died young.

At the public meeting held Thursday afternoon, angry and fearful civilians and veterans voiced fears that the chemicals were responsible for illnesses later developed.

Veteran John Chisholm said soldiers were told the sprays were harmless and to keep their mouths shut. “Now we found out this stuff here is killing us. No wonder all my buddies are dead.”

The Defence Department said Thursday that it was conducting tests to determine the dioxin level in the soil and consulting with the U.S. military to find out the exact carcinogen levels in the sprays used."

The Department of Defense is creating a new, super-secret organization to carry out clandestine activities that are now spread among several different agencies, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the plan. The move will establish a single office within the military for coordinating and directing covert operations overseas, including paramilitary raids, targeted killings, capture operations and specialized training for foreign forces, these sources said.
The creation of such an organization has long been discussed inside the U.S. government as a way","directly responsive to tasking from Secretary of Defense"" Donald Rumsfeld.

"In an interview by John D. O'Connor for the American magazine Vanity Fair, it was revealed that W. Mark Felt, a former","deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is the ""Deep Throat"" who provided information to journalist Bob Woodward on the Watergate scandal in 1972.
Woodward and his colleague Carl Bernstein were working for The Washington Post at the time. They had been pursuing the story about the break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters since June 17, when five burglars were caught inside. On June 20, they reported that one of the men arrested had worked for the CIA. This led them to suspect that there might be a","associate director of the FBI during the Nixon Administration, was the anonymous informer called ""Deep Throat"". ""Deep Throat"" helped journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bring down then-president Richard Milhous Nixon through the exposure of the Watergate scandal.

Previously bound by a pledge not to reveal ""Deep Throat's"" identity until after his death, Woodward and Bernstein at first refused to confirm the Vanity Fair report. However, in a story posted late today on the Washington Post website, they verified that Felt was ""Deep Throat.""

However, one of Richard Nixon's biographers, Jonathan Aitken, believes that at least one of ""Deep Throat's"" tips could not have been known by Felt. The Post first reported on the famous 18 1/2 minute gap in a crucial tape at a time when only six people were aware of its existence -- none of them Felt. This raises the possibility that ""Deep Throat,"" though mainly based on Felt, may be a composite character.

Felt has been mentioned as a leading candidate for ""Deep Throat"" by many that have tried to solve the mystery. An article published in the American Journalism Review last fall claimed Carl Bernstein's son once exposed Felt as the mysterious informer. But until now, Felt, Woodward, Bernstein and the Post's former editor Ben Bradlee have all denied it.

Felt, 91, has reportedly been in poor health in recent years. His family says Felt admits to being the source and described him as feeling proud of his role in history and having ""a big grin"" when told of the Vanity Fair article."

US forces responded with heavy weapons fire and eventually brought the situation under control. There are no reports how many insurgents were wounded or killed in the battle.

Public Inquiry is the title given to an official investigation, usually held under statutory powers, which may be required to establish facts or make recommendations on policy matters. The word 'inquiry' derives from the Latin verb inquīrere (","deeply controversial.

The processes and terms of reference of such 'Public' Inquiries are normally determined by the commissioning governmental body. However the Internet has now made possible the emergence of a new type of Public Inquiry, called an ""E-Inquiry"" that appears to be not only independent of government but also, like a Wiki, enables anyone who wishes to partake in the Inquiry to do so by contributing evidence and by posing questions that contribute to the process of determining the Terms of reference of the E-Inquiry.

The absence of a US government sponsored independent public inquiry into the Katrina hurricane disaster could well be the spur that led to the development of a new non-profit web site that incorporates a framework for conducting a Public E-Inquiry. That site http://www.ForumKatrina.org carries the banner line ""Katrina Support, Recovery, Planning &amp; E-Inquiry"".

The web site owners have given permission to quote the following extract from its statement on the web site about the objective of its E-Inquiry:

""Everyone who may think of getting involved in the E-Inquiry is asked to remember, at every stage in the process, that the end purpose of the E-Inquiry is to provide recommendations, for the future. The objective of those recommendations is to help everyone to avoid death, disease and destruction in consequence of forthcoming natural and man-made disasters. If those recommendations are to be taken seriously, and this, the first E-Inquiry, is to acquire any public credibility, then the process must be democratic, patently fair and intellectually rigorous.""

It will be interesting to see whether an E-Inquiry is capable of meeting these ideals and whether they become a common feature of internet activity."

The report by the Independent Inquiry Committee on the U.N. Oil-for-Food Program says Mr. Annan did not do enough to stop kickbacks and other fraud from taking place within the program. The inquiry was launched last April after revelations about how some companies profited from the oil-for-food program.

The report emphasized that Annan knowingly allowed Saddam Hussein to continue making huge unethical profits off of the program.

While Annan acknowledged that there was blame to pass around, he stated that ""None of us -- member states, Secretariat, agencies, funds and programs -- can be proud of what it has found."" Annan also says that he was at least partly at fault for the corruption; ""The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism.""

On a lighter note, while the report is critical of Annan, it also says that the Oil for Food program did help get food to many Iraqis."

A controversial patent directive has been thrown out in a landslide vote. 648 MEPs out of 680 voted today,"to scrap the draft law, which would have required firms to pay royalties on any computer programmes they copied or modified. The decision is a massive setback for the European Patent Office and its supporters.
The EU Parliament's Industry Committee had approved the proposal last year, but it was bitterly opposed by many software developers who said that it would stifle innovation and lead to high licence fees.
""We are delighted with this result,"" says John Newton, head of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE). ""It shows that there is no majority support for the","to reject the proposal, aimed at bringing Europe in-line with a similar U.S. bill.

"Romania's Ministry of European Integration has made public the text of the European Union's Accession Treaty with Romania and Bulgaria,","which will be signed in Luxembourg on 25th June.
The treaty is a lengthy document that sets out the conditions for EU accession by both countries, as well as their responsibilities once they join the bloc. It also provides for the transfer of competencies from Brussels to Bucharest and Sofia.
Romanian officials have said that the country must implement all the commitments it makes under the treaty within two years after signing it. The Bulgarian government has pledged to carry out its obligations within one year.
Bulgaria and Romania are expected","making it available on its website. The text of the treaty is available freely, in Romanian, at .

The Accession Treaty, which is due to be voted by the European Parliament on April 13 and signed on April 25, is the legal document facilitating Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the EU, which, according to the treaty, will take place on January 1, 2007.

The treaty's content has been posted online in order to inform Romanians of the costs, standards and responsibilities of European Union accession. The text was published after the European Commission asked for Romania and Bulgaria to better inform their citizens of what EU accession actually means. Bulgaria similarly made available the content of the treaty, in the Bulgarian language, in early April.

Once the Accession Treaty is signed, Romania and Bulgaria will have to withdraw from the Central European Free Trade Agreement, as they will be integrated into the EU-wide free trade area. Additionally, from April 25, the two countries will send observers to the European Parliament and will be able to participate in other European Union institutions and events as observers.

When the two countries join in 2007, the European Union will have 27 members in total and more than 480 million citizens. The timetable for accession, and the implementation of the treaty, however, will be in jeopardy if the European Parliament fails to approve the accession of the two countries on April 13, or if the two countries are deemed unprepared for accession by the European Commission, in which case the so-called safeguard clause will come into effect, postponing accession by one year."

Conservative leader Michael Howard condemned Matts' behaviour but refused to sack him. Conservative shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin, from neighbouring Dorset West, said that the message on the doctored photo was consistent with conservative policy.

"Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has dismissed the Minister of Housing, Alice Mobolaji Osomo, as part","of a wide-ranging shakeup in his government.
The president also replaced the ministers of Works and Infrastructure, Information and National Orientation, Labour and Productivity, Science and Technology, Water Resources, Environment, Youth Development and Sports.
A statement by Chief Press Secretary to Mr. Obasanjo, Chief Alex Ibru, said that Mrs. Osomo was sacked for her failure to live up to expectations.
It added that she had been found guilty of gross misconduct.
Mr. Ibru said that the new appointees would take effect from Thursday","of an on-going anti-corruption drive to clean up Nigeria's world image.

A statement from the president's office said Mr. Osomo was sacked after the sale of public property violated instructions. According to a BBC report, the Minister allocated more than 200 properties to top officials rather than going on public sale.

President Obasanjo has been vocal in tackling corruption and reportedly warned officials their greed is undermining his attempts to win international debt relief. In March, he fired Education Minister Fabian Osuji in a broadcast to the nation during which he said 14 people had been involved in fraud and accused Mr. Osuji of offering a bribe of 55 million naira (US$417,000) to senate president Adolfus Wabara in order to get a bigger budget for his ministry."
"Dr. Stephen Schoenthaler, a Professor of Criminal Justice at the California State University in Stanislaus, has long argued that there is a","direct relationship between crime and poverty.
Schoenthaler argues that when people are poor they have less money to spend on basic needs such as food, shelter and clothing. This lack of funds results in stress which then affects their behavior and increases the likelihood of criminal activity.
While this seems obvious, it’s not something we often discuss or even think about. It is also why some argue that poverty should be considered a form of mental illness.

Dr. Schoenthaler is well-known for a youth detention center study where violations of house rules fell by 37% when vending machines were removed and the cafeteria replaced canned food by fresh alternatives. He summarizes his findings by saying that “Having a bad diet right now is a better predictor of future violence than past violent behaviour.” In a very large test, Schoenthaler directed a study in meals at 803 New York City schools, in low-income neighbourhoods, finding that the number of students passing final exams increased by 16%.

Critics have questioned some of Dr. Schoenthaler findings, due to the lack of placebo control groups. However, more recent work by Dr. Bernard Gesch, a physiologist at the University of Oxford, has placed some of the work on a more scientific footing. Dr. Gesch found that nutrition supplements produced a 26% drop in violations of prison rules over a placebo, and a 37% decrease in violent offences. The Netherlands has embarked on a wider scale dietary research program in 14 prisons.

The short term behaviour consequences of ingesting sugar are well understood: an initial burst on energy, followed a sugar low in which your body produces adrenalin, which makes you irritable and explosive. However, Schoenthaler and Gesch suggest that there are long term impacts over and above the short term consequences of blood sugar variations."
"England squared the Ashes series against Australia by holding on for a 2 run victory at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Australia","won the toss and elected to bat first, making 301 all out from their 50 overs. The highest score was made by opener David Warner with 69 runs off 48 balls. England's reply began poorly when they lost wickets regularly until captain Alistair Cook came in at number three. He then proceeded to make an unbeaten 76 runs off 84 balls as he led his team home.

The match was notable for being the last appearance of former Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting who retired after the game.

## Match details","came close to victory themselves, however Steven Harminson took the wicket of Michael Kasprovic to clinch victory on the fourth day of the game.

The match looked to be in Englands hands following sterling batting from Kevin Pietersen (71, 20) and Andrew Flintoff (68, 73) which left the Australians needing to score 282 to win the match. The tourists were soon in trouble ending the third day at 175-8 with over 100 runs still to score and only 2 wickets in hand.

However on the fourth morning the Australian tailenders scored steadily and despite the loss of Shane Warne for 42 the final wicket pair closed in on the target.

The Edgbaston crowd were reduced to biting their nails as the match came down to the wire; Australia needing just 3 runs to win and England needing just one wicket.

Harmison produced a lifting delivery from just short of a length which Kasprovic could only fend off with a glove through to the England 'keeper Geraint Jones, leaving Australia agonisingly short of a memorable win and the series all square at one match each with three to play.

:WHEREAS, UN weapons inspectors showed prior to the invasion that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; and

:WHEREAS, there is further mounting evidence that the Administration lied or misled about ""mushroom clouds,"" ""connections to 9/11,"" and ""war as a last resort"" as they sought UN, Congressional, and public approvals;

:THEREFORE, RESOLVED, the DPW asks Congress to immediately begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.

The resolution alleges that the Bush administration ""lied or misled"" Congress and the American people concerning the justification for the war. The ""Downing Street memo"" and reports from U.N. weapons inspectors are mentioned as evidence of deception.

Newly elected state party Chairman Joe Wineke said, ""Democrats, not only in Wisconsin but throughout the U.S., have been outraged by what we believe has been a clear cover-up of why the U.S. went into Iraq,"" and that the resolution expresses ""the sense of frustration that Democrats in Wisconsin have over fighting a war for the wrong reasons.""

Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor, does not think the resolution will be successful and said that even if the House of Representatives began impeachment proceedings against the president and vice president, ""I don't think you can impeach the secretary of defense""."

""The first criminal attack was committed in one church at Muhuta district where a group of FNL fighters fired in the church and killed six people including a pastor. They also injured seven others"", Manirakiza said.

He said the rebels shot dead a local government official and his brother and also kidnapped a policeman in the same district.

""We don't know yet why these people were killed, they may be executed because they refused to adhere to the FNL ideology, as the area where they have been killed is an FNL stronghold.""

Some 300,000 people have been killed since the fighting began in 1993.

Fresh talks between the government and the FNL have raised hopes among diplomats that Burundi can finally lift one of its last big barriers to peace.

The Mozilla Foundation released the second major security update this week for their flagship browser Firefox. The fix patches a serious flaw in the way Firefox,"handles malicious downloads that could allow attackers to install malware on your system without you even clicking a link or opening an email attachment.
The problem is with how Firefox handles files downloaded from untrusted sources, like when you're surfing the Web and come across a suspicious-looking website. If Firefox isn't able to determine whether the file is safe, it will open it automatically. This can be dangerous if the file contains malware.
To address the issue, the new version of Firefox has been updated to warn users before downloading potentially harmful files. In addition, Firefox now blocks all download","handles animated GIF image files. Firefox browsers infected by malicious code could experience a buffer overflow, temporarily locking up or ""freezing"" a user's computer, or even executing arbitrary code which could take over a user's computer.

The flaw was discovered and reported by Internet Security Systems, Inc. The upgrade was the second major security fix in less than a month for the browser, which has grown in popularity to ten percent of the browser market in the United States.

Although there were no known exploits of the bug, Chris Hoffman, director of engineering at Mozilla, told reporters, ""because Mozilla is committed to delivering the most secure product possible, we decided to quickly issue an update to patch the bug.""

The Mozilla Foundation did not offer any details about the issue of vulnerability, but a second major security overhaul in such a short time underscores challenges faced by the nonprofit foundation as it goes head-to-head with the market leading Internet Explorer browser by Microsoft.

The new release, Firefox version 1.0.2, ""illustrates the dedication of the strong community of developers working on the product,"" according to Hoffman. ""...we’re able to turn around patches much faster than a traditional corporation,"" he added.

Users can download the update at no charge, and can find additional information at the Mozilla website."
Despite assurances from the European Commissioner for the Internal Market Charles McCreevy that the Council would adopt its controversial Common Position text covering Software,"Patents by 20 November, it seems unlikely that this will happen.
The drafting of the document is still incomplete and there are a number of issues which need to be clarified before a final version can be agreed upon. The most contentious point concerns the definition of software patentable subject-matter. This has been left ambiguous in order to allow member states to decide on their own national laws. However, as we reported last week, some countries have already taken steps towards passing new legislation which could lead to an increase in software patents.
It now appears that the Council may not even vote on","Patents, members voted to restart the entire process with a new directive.

MEP Michel Rocard noted several ""inelegancies"" by the Commission in his speech against the directive, such as not taking into account any of the Parliament's substantive amendments in its recommendation to the Council. He also took the Dutch and German governments to task for ignoring their respective parliaments. The Irish Presidency's sponsorship by Microsoft was also criticised, as were the attempted ratifications at fishery Council meetings.

There was also confusion over the actual effects of the proposed directive with industry players confirming that the Council text allowed pure software patents, while the Commission claimed it would not.

""In the debate, broad agreement prevailed over the fact that the current proposal was counter-productive and far from a good basis for a decision,"" said Italian MEP Monica Frassoni.

"Bobby Abreu, welcome to the spotlight.

The Philadelphia Phillies star, now 31 and a two-time All-Star",", is one of baseball's most underrated hitters. But he has been on fire in June, batting .405 with seven home runs and 26 RBIs. He also leads the National League in extra-base hits (29).

""I think it's time for people to recognize what I can do,"" said Abreu, who was named NL player of the week after his performance last week. ""It's something that's going to happen.""

Abreu has had plenty of company this season. The Phillies have four players - Ryan Howard",", has produced well for the Phillies over the last half a decade without the glamour of other top players. However, last night there was no denying that he was the star of the show.

And what a show it was. The first batter in the 2005 Home Run Derby, Abreu proceeded to shatter the previous record of 15 home runs in a round, belting 24, including a 517-foot moonshot that exited the stadium in right field, going through two bats in the process. This rampage came immediately after ESPN announcers Chris Berman and Joe Morgan described Comerica Park, the site of the Derby, as a difficult park to hit home runs in.

In the second round, Abreu edged past Boston's David Ortiz (who himself hit an astounding 17 homeruns in the first round) and Milwaukee's Carlos Lee to earn a spot in the finals alongside Detroit star Ivan Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who snuck into the second round with 7 dingers, swatted the most in the second round, but his home-field advantage deserted him in the finals as Abreu smashed 11 over the fences to win the Derby for his native Venezuela.

Abreu's three-round total of 41 homers broke Miguel Tejada's record of 27, set last year in Houston's Minute Maid Park."

"Blogshine Sunday, a national effort among webloggers to publicize the importance of open access to government information is scheduled to take place on March","20. The event will be co-sponsored by the Center for Citizen Media and the Open Society Institute's Information Program.
The idea was launched last year by Cursor.org editor in chief John Schwartz. This year, he has invited others to join him in helping to promote the cause.
""We have an opportunity to raise awareness about this important issue,"" said Schwartz. ""Blogshine is a chance to talk about it.""
Schwartz hopes that bloggers from all over the country will participate. He also encourages those who are not weblog","13, 2005.

On that day, FreeCulture.org will organize web-based writers to relate their experiences and thoughts on open-access to governmental records and freely available public information. Webloggers will be encouraged to highlight the need to have public records available in electronic formats to facilitate easier searching of information and more widespread access. Another goal of Blogshine Sunday is to emphasize that open access to governmental information should be granted to everyone, unpaid reporters and bloggers as well as professional journalists.

Recently, bloggers have played an important role in shaping public opinion about issues that were initially overlooked by traditional media. Freerepublic.com blogger Harry W. MacDougald was the first to scrutinize documents that suggested that President Bush was derelict in his military service in the 1970s. CBS News reported on the documents as if they were legitimate, but MacDougald discovered that the documents used a typestyle that was not available at the time they were supposedly written. Following MacDougald’s blog posts questioning the documents, CBS said that they regretted reporting on the documents as though they were authentic. Since bloggers are generally unpaid and do not have the editorial restrictions of professional journalists, as the MacDougald example illustrates, they are sometimes better able to research and report on issues not covered by traditional media.

Blogshine Sunday is held in conjunction with Sunshine Sunday, when professional journalists and news media will publish articles and editorials on the importance of the open records. Freeculture.org was started last April by two college students in an effort to show that technology can better facilitate public affairs involvement.

Schapelle Corby was today found guilty by an Indonesian court for the importation of 4 kilograms of marijuana to Bali,".
The verdict is a massive blow to her family who have been campaigning tirelessly for her release since she was arrested in October 2004.
Corby, who has spent more than nine years behind bars, will be sentenced on Thursday and faces up to 20 years in jail.
She had pleaded not guilty to the charge but prosecutors claimed that DNA evidence linked her to the drugs which were hidden inside boogie board boxes.
In his summing up, Judge Indra Sagafudin said: ""There are many arguments from both parties",". She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The verdict was handed down by three judges amidst tight security at the Denpasar District Court.

The verdict was read in Indonesian and relayed to Corby via her translator. The court erupted as the outcome became clear. Her family and supporters screamed at the judge, and said that justice had not been done. ""Scheppelle is innocent!"" one supporter said.

Her lawyer reported before the verdict was handed down that she was terrified. ""She's probably the worst I've ever seen her,"" he said.

After the verdict she stopped briefly to hug her family before being loaded into a van and driven away.

Corby was arrested at Denpasar Airport last October. On her trip to Bali, she flew from Brisbane to Sydney and then changed planes. Her defense centered around the claim that Australian airport baggage handlers placed the drugs in her bodyboard bag as part of a drug smuggling ring. It was claimed that the drugs were being smuggled from Brisbane to Sydney, but for some reason were not removed before her luggage was transferred to the Indonesian flight.

After a lengthy trial that attracted much media attention in Australia, prosecutors called for the judges to hand down a life sentence.

Hundreds of supporters and friends gathered at Tugun Surf-Lifesaving Club on the Gold Coast to watch the verdict and show their support.

Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that he felt for Corby but that Australians had to trust the Indonesian justice system. ""We have to respect the justice system of other countries,"" he said.

The judge said she had until next Wednesday to appeal."

The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is deploying its new Homeland Security Information Network - Secret (HSIN-Secret) in,"a phased approach.
The DHS has awarded contracts to two companies for the development and deployment of HSIN-Secret, which will be used by all federal law enforcement agencies as well as state and local police forces.
According to an official at the DHS' Science & Technology Directorate, the first phase of the programme involves the installation of servers that will store data from participating organisations. This will enable users to access information on terrorism suspects and other criminal activities through their organisation's secure networks.
""We are doing this in phases so we can make sure everything works,"" said","all 50 state Emergency Operations Centers as well as 18 additional state and local law enforcement sites. ""The secret network is a component of the HSIN, which is the primary conduit for DHS to share information on terrorist threats, suspicious activity and incident management with state, local, tribal and private-sector officials."" reports Government Computer News.

Development on this $350 million system by Northrop Grumman Corporation was begun in March of 2004 with basic operation achieved in just 4 months.

""The Homeland is more secure when each hometown is more secure,"" said Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge in DHS's February 24, 2004 press release that launched the program. ""Future program expansion will include the county level, communication at the classified SECRET level, and the involvement of the private sector."" it continues.

With the ""Secret"" component in place, classified information can now be disseminated to authorized individuals at all levels of government and business throughout the country almost instantly. HSIN lets most government agencies as well as many private companies doing business with the government share information on the whereabouts and suspicious activities of anyone that comes to their attention. Internal policies and the judgement of the system's users provide privacy and civil rights protections, while who can access the system is determined by DHS."
