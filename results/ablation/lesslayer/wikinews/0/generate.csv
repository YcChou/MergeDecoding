"On Monday, the Israeli army withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Palestinians rejoiced over this occasion, with Mahmoud Abb","as calling it a ""historic day.""
But what does this mean for Israel? Will they be able to live in peace now that their enemies are gone? Will there be no more suicide bombings and rocket attacks on them? Will they finally have peace?
The answer is NO! The reason why is because of the fact that Hamas has not been defeated. They still control the Gaza strip. And as long as they do, they will continue to attack Israel.
Hamas is an Islamic terrorist organization which was founded by Muslims who wanted to destroy Israel. They believe that all Jews must","as saying that ""This is a day of happiness and joy that the Palestinian people have not witnessed for a century.""

The 38 years of Israeli presence in the Gaza strip have officially ended.

Palestinians were overjoyed at the sight of the burning synagogues, planting flags in the midst of it all, and shouting cries of independence. Teenagers set fire to a few synagogues, letting out anger at Israel's occupation.

The fires did little damage to the concrete structures, but Abbas said that the Palestinians planned to destroy them fully.

Palestinian police admitted that there was not much they could or would do to stop this.

Last year, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy the synagogues, but this Sunday, under pressure from religious Jewish organizations, it reversed its decision. Palestinians were angry at the cabinet's Sunday vote.

The synagogues, as well as all community structures, including community centers, schools, and sports facilites, are the only physical remnants of the Israeli Gaza Strip presence since all residential structures have been destroyed."
"Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, today announced that the 2004/2005 season of the National Hockey League","will begin on October 7th.
The announcement was made at a press conference in New York City and is expected to be welcomed by fans across North America who have been waiting for an end to the lockout which has seen the cancellation of over half of the regular season games.
""We are pleased to announce that we have reached agreement with our players,"" said Bettman. ""I want to thank them for their patience and understanding during this difficult time.""
Bettman also praised the owners for their co-operation throughout the negotiations. ""They were very supportive of us","has been canceled. The announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days. The dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players. The majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount. The club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million. Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said ""The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.""

This will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded. That year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off."
"German news magazine Der Spiegel reported today that a letter from an extremist Islamic organization calling itself ""Secret Organisation Group of Al-Qaeda of","Jihad in Europe"" was sent to the editorial offices of several major European newspapers, including The New York Times and Le Monde.
The letter, which is signed by ""the Secret Organization Group of al Qaeda of Jihad in Europe,"" threatens attacks on European targets unless the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad are stopped.
""We will continue our fight against you until we destroy your democratic system,"" the letter reads. ""We will not stop fighting you until you release all Muslims from prisons.""
The letter also warns that if the carto","Jihad Organisation"" has appeared, a previously unheard-of organization, claiming responsibility for the explosions in London today. The BBC later released a statement, translated from Arabic, from the group. The text reads as follows:

In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate, may peace be upon the cheerful one and undaunted fighter, Prophet Muhammad, God's peace be upon him.

Nation of Islam and Arab nation: Rejoice for it is time to take revenge against the British Zionist Crusader government in retaliation for the massacres Britain is committing in Iraq and Afghanistan. The heroic mujahideen have carried out a blessed raid in London. Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters.

We have repeatedly warned the British Government and people. We have fulfilled our promise and carried out our blessed military raid in Britain after our mujahideen exerted strenuous efforts over a long period of time to ensure the success of the raid.

We continue to warn the governments of Denmark and Italy and all the Crusader governments that they will be punished in the same way if they do not withdraw their troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. He who warns is excused.

God says: ""You who believe: If ye will aid (the cause of) Allah, He will aid you, and plant your feet firmly.

The statement was published on Qal3ah, an internet forum which has been used before for announcements by Al-Qaeda, though the validity of the claims are currently unconfirmed. At a press conference, the Metropolitan Police stated they had not received any claims of responsibility from any group."
Molson Canada picks up Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. as the company maneuvers to make an entry into the craft beer,"market in Ontario.
Molson Coors Brewing Company has purchased Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd., a small brewery located near Creemore, Ontario. The purchase is part of Molson's plan to enter the Canadian craft beer market. Creemore will continue to operate under its current brand name and management team.
""Creemore is one of the most respected brands in the Canadian craft beer industry,"" said Denise Morrison, president and CEO of Molson Coors. ""We are pleased to have Creemore join our portfolio of leading","market.

Creemore Springs of Creemore, Ontario, produces the locally popular Creemore Springs lager. The merger will allow the company to retain its identity.

""The Creemore brand image and brewing craft will remain unchanged,"" Creemore Springs Brewery chairman Bill Wilder said. ""Molson understands and appreciates what is special about the Creemore brand and this makes them a great purchaser for the company.""

Industry observers are mixed on the benefits of the deal for Molson. The CBC reports one analyst suggests Molson may be trying to replicate the success of rival Labatt's premium beers. Others point out the small brewery model does not scale up well, and the attraction of a ""boutique"" beer fades in large-scale production.

Molson Coors Brewing Co., formed by the US$3.4 billion merger in February of two family-run companies, Canadian Molson and U.S. Coors brewing companies, is the fifth largest brewer in the world by volume. ( TSX:TAP.NV, NYSE:TAP)"
The World Health Organisation has announced that the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatments (ART) in developing countries is increasing significantly - more,"than 1.3 million people are now on treatment, up from just over 800,000 a year ago.
The WHO's latest report shows that the number of people starting ART increased by 25% between June and December last year, with the largest increase seen in sub-Saharan Africa.
""This is an encouraging sign,"" said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the WHO. ""It means we have reached a tipping point where the benefits of HIV treatment outweigh the costs.""
However, she warned that there was still much to","than doubling between December 2003 and June 2005. One million people are now getting the drugs they need, compared to just 400,000 eighteen months ago.

However, access to treatment is not growing as fast as demand, and the UN is unlikely to reach its target of treating three million people by the end of 2005 - just over half the people who need it. The longer-term target of universal treatment by 2010 is still likely to be met.

The figures show that the number of people receiving ART is increasing in every part of the globe, but not as quickly as people are contracting HIV. The numbers getting treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, the part of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS has increased threefold on a year ago, and doubled in the last six months. The same rate of growth as also been seen in Asia, the second-worst affected area.

The WHO's report highlights that the best progress has been made when governments have worked together with the WHO, the UN and other parterners. The report goes on to make recommendations for simplifying the process to enable treatment levels to be increased even faster.

The UN's target was based on what was hypothetically possible if all possible steps to provide treatment were taken. The report shows the while financial, political and technical steps have been made, other areas are falling short.

Pressure groups said that countries were reacting too slowly to the pandemic and called on the G8 to provide more sustainable funding for universal treatment for Aids.

UK international development minister Gareth Thompson said: ""We are committed to universal access to HIV treatments by 2010. We will spend £1.5bn in the next three years on Aids, including £150m on orphans."""
A recent survey conducted by the American Cancer Society has turned up some surprising results: Americans generally hold false beliefs about the nature of cancer and its treatment,".
The study, which was published in the journal CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, found that 40 percent of respondents believed that a person with cancer could be cured if he or she stopped smoking, while another 25 percent thought that exercise would help prevent cancer. In fact, neither is true.
""These findings suggest that there are still many misperceptions about cancer,"" said lead researcher Dr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society. ""People need to know that they can't do anything to prevent",", even though many believe they are well informed.

Health experts say this ignorance could be dangerous: People may be making poor health decisions -- avoiding cancer screenings or rejecting potentially life-saving treatments -- based on their incorrect notions.

The most common misconception is that surgery causes cancer to spread. Decades ago, cancer often was not discovered until it was very advanced. At that stage, surgical efforts were rarely successful, and many patients died soon after procedures were performed. This may have given rise to the mistaken belief that the surgeries caused the disease to worsen.

Another commonly held myth is that there is a cure for cancer, but the medical industry is withholding it in order to continue profiting from the sale of less effective treatments and medications.

Believers in this ""conspiracy theory"" may not be guided by it in making their personal health decisions, though. The American Cancer Society says that even though many people are suspicious of the medical industry in general, they have a trusting relationship with their own physicians and are likely to follow their advice.

Almost 20 percent of the people surveyed felt that medications for cancer pain were ineffective.

About 10 percent expressed the belief that cancer could be cured with a positive attitude alone, while a similar number felt that there was no effective treatment for cancer.

The fact is, cancer survival and treatments -- including pain management -- have vastly improved in the last thirty years.

Results of the survey appear in the August 1 issue of Cancer, a journal published by the American Cancer Society."

Iraq has carried out the first executions since the demise of the Saddam Hussein regime. Three men convicted of murder were hanged,"in Baghdad on Tuesday, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice.
The three men were executed at Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad, after being sentenced to death by an Iraqi court last month. The trio had been found guilty of killing two policemen and a civilian during a robbery in 2003.

Brazil is threatening to break the patent of US-based Abbott Laboratories as it pushes ahead with its programme to supply its people with,"free medicine.
The country's health ministry has said that it will not renew a licence for an anti-seizure drug called Depakote, which is produced by Abbott and sold in Brazil under the brand name Valproate.
Abbott has been given until 15 December to respond to the threat. If it does not comply, then the government will issue a decree allowing local manufacturers to produce the drug without paying a royalty fee.
""We are going to make this decision because we have no other choice,"" said Luiz Barreto, head of the","free AIDS drugs.

Brazil has given Abbott a deadline of July 7 to cut the prices of its drug Kaletra or a Brazilian company will begin cloning it. This move would test recent World Trade Organization concessions allowing poor countries to produce generic drugs for local health emergencies.

Abbott has said that Brazil's demand goes ""against the spirit"" of the WTO agreement, since it has the ninth largest economy in the world, and that this could damage future research for improved treatments.

Previous programmes have been negotiated between companies and governments to produce generic versions of AIDS drugs, but this is the first time a country has threatened to use powers negotiated at the WTO by producing the drug without the cooperation of the patent holder.

Several campaign groups are supporting the move, hoping that other developing countries will be able to take the lead of Brazil and produce generic drugs for their own populations. Michael Bailey, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam International, said: ""The impact of breaking the patent would be enormous. If a major country such as Brazil goes through with this, not only will it help ensure sustainability of their excellent treatment programme, it will set a hugely important precedent for other countries.""

The US Chamber of Commerce has issued a statement urging Brazil to reconsider and suggesting that the move could create a rift between the countries. Thomas Donohue, Chamber President and CEO said: ""Brazil’s threat to strip patent rights from a U.S. company should concern all investors and every business around the world because of the precedent it sets for the treatment of intellectual property."""
Millions of origami cranes have been dropped on Thailand's three southern provinces following violence between the government and ethnic minority Muslim populations,".
The paper birds are meant to symbolise peace, but they also serve as a reminder that the conflict has claimed more than 2,000 lives since 2004.
""We want to show our support for the people in the south,"" said one volunteer who helped fold the cranes at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport. ""They need help.""
Thai authorities say the insurgency is being fuelled by Islamic militants from neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia. But many observers believe it is driven by local grievances over",". The move has been called a ""goodwill gesture"" towards Muslims.

Up to 120 million such paper sculptures were dropped on Thailand's three southern-most provinces, Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. Tensions in this area have increased recently, peaking with the recent death of 85 demonstrators arrested during a protest. The government blamed their deaths on physical weakness due to fasting in the month of Ramadan as the cause, as most if not all the deaths occurred during transport of up to 500 arrested protestors. Critics of the Thai government have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, blaming the ""over-eagerness"" of Thai security forces as the cause of the deaths.

The dispersal was timed to coincide with the birthday of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and has generated much interest from the rest of the country's predominantly Buddhist population.
The cranes were built by citizens throughout Thailand and had peace messages written on them. The southern, Muslim provinces are often considered neglected by a north that is larger and of the majority ethnic group. Some have welcomed the goodwill gesture, but critics in both the north and south have said that the resources would have been better spent solving the problems in the south. Some Islamic leaders in the south have also expressed concerns that the gesture may not be properly understood by Muslims, as the crane carries no cultural significance with them."
"In the wake of a United States Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. New London on eminent domain last week, a California man has proposed","that his town seize and demolish his house to make way for a shopping mall.
The case involved Connecticut officials who used their power of eminent domain to take private property from one person and give it to another. The court ruled 5-4 that local governments can use eminent domain to transfer land from one private owner to another if the new owner will put the property to better public use than the original owner.
""I'm not going to let them do this,"" said John Mariani, whose home is located near the site of the proposed shopping center. ""I'll fight them all","that Justice David Souter's New Hampshire home be seized by the state and a hotel be built on the site. Logan Darrow Clements faxed a letter to town officials in Weare, New Hampshire June 28, 2005 that justified the action as such:

""The justification for such an eminent domain action is that our hotel will better serve the public interest as it will bring in economic development and higher tax revenue to Weare.""

Justice Souter, who was in the majority ruling in the Kelo case, has lived at the farmhouse in Weare since he was 11 years old. Clements indicated that it was necessary to build on that location because ""it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans."" The action has given rise to a great deal of support nationwide, as many are writing to the councilors of the small town of Weare to voice their approval for the proposal.

The proposal for the ""Lost Liberty Hotel"", as it is to be called, features a number of components which seem to focus on the libertarian leanings of its designer. A dining room, called the ""Just Desserts Cafe"" and a museum based on the ""loss of freedom in America"" are two such components. Instead of a Bible provided by the Gideons (a standard item placed in most American hotel rooms), each guest will receive a free copy of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged."
People all over the Netherlands are voting today in a referendum on the EU constitution. This the first national referendum for two hundred years and it is non,"-binding, but will be taken into account by the government when deciding whether to ratify the treaty.
The Dutch have been asked to vote Yes or No to the following question: ""Do you agree that the European Union should adopt the new Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe?""
I'm not going to go into the pros and cons of the treaty here - there are plenty of other places where you can read about them. I just want to say how pleased I am that we have this opportunity to express our views. It's important that people feel they have some control over their own lives and that","-binding. Though most major political parties have stated they will abide by the referendum if the outcome is sufficiently clear and a large enough percentage of the voters have actually voted.
The question put to voters will be:

:Bent U voor of tegen instemming door Nederland met het verdrag tot vaststelling van een grondwet voor Europa?
:""Are you for or against approval by the Netherlands of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe?""

All the main political parties have asked for a voor (for, or yes) vote. However polls have been saying that two-thirds of the people will be voting tegen (against, or no).

One reason for people to vote no is the expansion of the European Union with large countries like Turkey, which they fear will cause less influence for the smaller countries. The view of an European super state in which the Netherlands would loose its own identity is another reason for voting no. Some of the no voters do this to show they don't agree with the current political situation and the supposed risen prices since the introduction of the euro.

As of 14:00 CET, 9% more voters had turned up for the referendum than for the European elections.

However, other detainees have been reported as saying, ""It is better in front of Baxter, I believe showing Baxter, protesters will shout about human torture inside detention. Then there would be good publicity about all torture inside Baxter detention.""

And, ""We welcome all of the protesters and we thank them all who has seen disgrace of this human torture. Further we thank to you all who come and visit and looking after us all the time, we need it.""

""I think the American administration should do something to help us out of this crisis,""",", Samir Sumaidaie, declared to reporters that the international body of the United Nations helped the regime of Saddam Hussein. This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's Oil-for-Food program with Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali although there is no charge against him in the report.

In an interview with Voice of America reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie said: ""In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later.... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program.""

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.

After being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said: ""Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him.""

On Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: ""We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it."""
"Bitmover, the company producing a management program for computer source code named Bitkeeper (BK), announced on April 5 that it will no longer","sell BK to Japanese customers.
Bitkeeper is a software development tool used by companies and research institutes in Japan to manage their source codes. It was developed by Bitmover Inc., an American company based in California. The product has been sold in Japan since 1998.
The reason why Bitmover decided not to sell BK to Japanese customers is because of the recent ruling by the Tokyo District Court which ordered Microsoft Corp. to pay $613 million as compensation for damages caused by its violation of patents held by Alcatel-Lucent SA.
Al","be providing a free version of its product.

As a result of Bitmover's announcement, the programmer who wrote the original Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds, stated on a mailing list that he ""decided to not use BK mainly because he needs to figure out the alternatives"". As to an alternative to Bitkeeper, Torvalds hinted that he is considering Monotone but that Subversion, a recent replacement for CVS, is out of the running. Bitkeeper was originally developed to allow Torvalds to manage code contributions more easily, according to Jeremy Andrews at Kerneltrap.org, and was previously provided to kernel developers free of charge, though it was restricted in its use.

Bitkeeper is the software that Torvalds and hundreds of other Linux developers use to manage submissions of code to the Linux kernel, the heart of the computer operating systems referred to as ""Linux"" or ""GNU/Linux"". Linux is distributed in many different forms, bundled with other software by companies such as Red Hat, Novell, and Linspire.

While the details are not clear, it appears from Andrews' article that Bitmover's decision to stop releasing the free version of Bitkeeper is related to a dispute with Torvalds' employer, Open Source Development Labs (OSDL).

According to Kerneltrap, an OSDL contractor had been reverse engineering the free version of Bitkeeper in order to make an open source replacement, which is prohibited by the license under which the free version of Bitkeeper is released. Nevertheless, Torvalds notes in his post that he is ""personally very happy with BK, and with Larry McVoy, the CEO of Bitmover."""

The Australian Federal Government has revealed today that it is going to give A$21 million (US $15.76 million) as compensation,"for the victims of the 2013 bushfires in New South Wales and Queensland.
The money will be given to those who lost their homes, livelihoods or businesses due to the fires.

""We are committed to supporting our communities through this difficult time,"" Prime Minister Julia Gillard said. ""This funding will ensure that people have access to the assistance they need.""
The announcement comes after a report by","to approximately 600 former RAAF maintenance workers, who where exposed to highly toxic chemicals while working on the fuel tanks of the nation's F-111 fleet.

Under the government's proposal, depending on the amount of exposure, a worker can expect to receive between A$10,000 and A$40,000 (US $7,500 - $30,000) to help cope with the side effects. The aircraft maintenance program started in the 1970s and was suspended in the late 1990s when the former workers started to show signs of medical problems ranging from memory loss to neurological problems.

The F-111 Deseal/Reseal Support Group responded to the government's package with anger. The Group's president Ian Fraser said ""A$40,000 for a ruined life is simply not enough ... We've already got people who have died, who are dying, people who have lost their homes.""

The third Test ended in a draw (with England one wicket away from a win), and England narrowly won the fourth Test in Nottingham by three wickets after the English enforced follow on after a poor first innings by Australia.

The fifth and final Test started on 8 September at the Oval in London. It entered its final day evenly balanced with all results still possible and the destination of the urn still in doubt. Australia needed to win to force a 2-2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give them to England, ending 18 years and eight series of Australian dominance. In the end, England managed to bat out the final day, and a draw ensured the Ashes were coming back to England.

Kevin Pietersen and Ashley Giles hit personal bests of 158 and 59 respectively, to bat out the best part of the last day. Pieterson's 158 was his maiden test century, and included 7 sixes. Early in the day, Australia looked to be in with a chance of winning the match, with early wickets leaving England at 67 for 3. Giles and Pietersen's century partnership, though, left Australia with no hope of catching England in the remains of the day, sealing England's Ashes win since 1987.

England's next Tests will be an away series in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the world champions Australia will play an ICC World XI (which inclues Kevin Pietersen, Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff) in the Johnnie Walker Super Series in early October."
Space.com reported yesterday on a picture of a planet taken by the Very Large Telescope located in Chile. The European Southern Observatory's,"VLT is one of the world's largest telescopes, and it has been used to take pictures of planets orbiting other stars.
The image shows a planet that orbits a star 100 light-years away from Earth. It is about twice as massive as Jupiter, but only half as wide. This means that its gravity is much stronger than Jupiter's, which makes it difficult for scientists to determine what kind of atmosphere it might have.
""It could be like Jupiter with an oxygen-rich atmosphere,"" said astronomer Christian Marois of the National Research Council of","telescope, which was used to capture the picture, has made the first confirmed discovery of a planet orbiting another star.

Scientists have been trying to locate planets outside our own solar system for nearly 10 years. Inferences of nearly 150 planets in other solar systems have been observed so far by using instruments and measurements that only suggest the existence of another planet. Until now, no planet has been confirmed by the means of a photographed image. There was, months earlier, another team of scientists who took pictures of what might be another planet, but that image remains controversial because it shows what may be an even more distant object instead.

The research team that photographed the planet with its host star was led by Ralph Neuhaeuser of the Astrophysical Institute &amp; University Observatory (AIU). ""The detection of the faint object near the bright star is certain,"" he told Space.com on Friday.

The new image contains the star, GQ Lupi, with an orbiting planet. It is smaller than our sun, 70% the size, and is located 400 light-years away from our solar system. The planet is nearly twice the size of Jupiter. Unlike our sun which is 4.6 billion years old, the GQ Lupi star is approximately 1 million years old and is considered very young for a star. The planet orbiting GQ Lupi is three times further out than Neptune's orbit around our sun, and scientists estimate the orbiting period to be about 1,200 years. The planets wide orbiting distance from the GQ Lupi was an important element for enabling the photograph to be taken.

The planet, much like the star it orbits, is very hot &amp;mdash; about 2,000 degrees Kelvin &amp;mdash; so despite the detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, which at that temperature would make it gaseous, there is no expectation it might support life.

The discovery will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics."
"Young Quakers who planned to take part in the World Gathering of Young Friends at Lancaster University, England have been unable to attend after having","their visas refused.
The group was due to leave for England on 25 July but were told by the British Embassy that they would not be granted visas. The young people are now planning to appeal against the decision.
""We're very disappointed,"" said one member of the group. ""We feel we've done everything right and it seems like a lot of effort has gone into nothing.""
The group had already paid £100 each towards the cost of attending the gathering which is being held from 3-8 August. They also spent time preparing for the event including","their visas denied.

Their absence has been a cause of ""hurt"" at the meetings. Sara Wolcott of Pacific Yearly Meeting on the Western coast of America wrote in a journal on the WGYF website: ""I saw in a workshop for Friends planning to meet in Kenya how much the absence of so many Friends was felt; the gathering felt incomplete. We desperately wanted our brothers and sisters to be with us, I know they wanted to be here too.""

Most of the denials were for economic reasons, if someone doesn't have a high enough income or a fixed job it can be assumed that they will stay in the country for work. Representatives from the gathering now plan to go to Kenya in October to share some of the programme with those who were unable to come.

Despite the missing Friends, the gathering has brought together a mix of different Quaker traditions in a positive atmosphere that has been appreciated by participants. Many Quakers worship in silence (unprogrammed meetings) while others, particularly in America and Africa, have ministers like other churches. Quakers also have differences of opinion over theological issues, including even the existence of God, but the young Friends have not found this to be an obstacle to coming together. Unlike many traditional Christian sects, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, encourage each member to explore his or her own relationship with God.

Chrissy Muhr of Northwest Yearly Meeting (Northwest US) wrote: ""I've been really impressed by how the mix of worship styles has been handled. Almost all the programmed Friends I've spoken to have some prior experience of unprogrammed worship. For me, the hardest thing has been not falling asleep during long periods of silence - the long week has begun to take its toll."""
A new redesigned US $10 bill was introduced at a ceremony yesterday on Ellis Island. The new bill adds three new background colors; red,", blue and green.
The new design is meant to be more secure than the old one. It has been designed with anti-counterfeiting features such as a 3D security ribbon that changes color when tilted or moved. There are also watermarks and microprinting.
The new bills will start circulating in October of this year. They will replace the current ones which have been in use since 2006.
The new design is based on the theme ""democracy."" It includes images of famous Americans who helped shape democracy in America including Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King",", yellow and orange. It continues to feature Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. The $10 bill is the third US bill to switch from the traditional green. The $20 and $50 bills were redesigned to feature color within the past two years.

The improvements in digital technology have made it much easier for counterfeiters. ""Ten years ago, 1 percent of (counterfeit) bills were produced on digital equipment. These days, 56 percent are produced on digital equipment, and the technology is more accessible to the general population,"" said Eric Zahren, spokesman for the Secret Service.

According to the Treasury Department, to be able to keep ahead of counterfeiters currency will need to continue to be updated every seven to ten years. The $10 bill was last redesigned in 2000. ""The intention was not to create a counterfeit-proof note&amp;mdash;which is basically impossible&amp;mdash;but one that's harder to duplicate and easier to authenticate,"" said Zahren. This new bill includes many new and enhanced security features such as color-shifting ink, a watermark, microprinting and a security thread

Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said in a statement ""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. Government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure."" The new $10 bill is expected to go into circulation in early 2006."

"House Democrats called for an investigation into possible voting fraud and irregularities during the 2004 U.S. presidential election, according","to a letter sent by Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) on Wednesday.
Conyers is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He wrote in his letter that he has received ""numerous allegations"" about problems with electronic voting machines used in last year's elections. The machines are manufactured by companies such as Diebold Inc., Election Systems & Software LLC and Sequoia Voting Systems Inc.
The letter was sent to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. It asks them to investigate whether there were any violations","to a Dec. 23 letter from House Representative David Wu (D-OR).

Thousands of Ohio citizens have reported experiencing problems casting their votes due to long lines at polling places, malfunctioning voting machines, inexplicable numbers of votes cast, and disenfranchisement in urban areas.

""The integrity of our democracy is at stake. We need to give the American people confidence that each and every vote will be properly counted and that the democratic electoral process is respected,"" Wu said. ""I also understand concerns about the conflict of interest of having an official in charge of running elections in a key state also heading a presidential campaign. I agree that Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell's dual role calls into question any election decision he made that favored Republicans.""

Other Congressmen including John Conyers (D-MI), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and Robert Wexler (D-FL) voiced similar concerns, and requested an investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), citing specific cases in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, and California.

In December, Conyers, the Ranking Democrat on the House Committee on the Judiciary, issued a series of letters about voting irregularities to the media, campaign officials, and manufacturers of voting equipment. These letters seek to collect and preserve information regarding the conduct of the election.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office previously reported on voting irregularities in eariler presidential elections.

A September 14, 2004 GAO report on the 2000 presidential elections detailed changes the DOJ implemented to try to ensure voter access to polls, and the importance of monitoring election-day activities. The report warned that allegations in the 2000 election lacked sufficient specifics to enable the DOJ to perform and adequate investigation and recommended that more precise information be collected regarding voting for the 2004 presidential election."
"Missing American teen Natalee Holloway, who vanished on the Dutch island of Aruba two weeks ago, is feared to be","dead after her body was found in a shallow grave.
The 18-year-old's remains were discovered by police yesterday near an abandoned sugar mill where she had been staying with friends before disappearing.
A forensic team has begun examining the site and will use dental records to confirm whether it is indeed Ms Holloway.
Police chief Gerold Dompig said: ""We have found human remains that we believe are those of Natalee.""
Ms Holloway disappeared while on holiday with classmates from Mountain Brook High School in Alabama. She was","dead today following a suspect's statement earlier this morning. The suspect, who is yet to be named, told police that ""something bad happened"" to the missing teen. Police Commissioner District 1 Gerold Dompig said that the suspect was leading police to a scene, where it is believed a major update to the case is to be found.

Two security guards were taken into police custody early last week: 28-year-old Abraham Jones and 30-year-old Mickey John. Additionally, three teenagers who were believed to be the last people to have seen Halloway are now under custody. Among the three teenagers is 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe, 21-year-old Depak Kalpoe, and 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, a friend of the brothers and son to a Judicial Servant.

Representatives of both the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) signed a peace pledge today in the,"Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. The agreement is meant to end 21 years of civil war between the two parties, which has killed an estimated 2 million people.
The signing ceremony was attended by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said he hoped it would lead to ""a new era for Sudan.""
""I hope that this will be the beginning of a new era for Sudan,"" Mr. Annan told reporters after the signing. ""It is my sincere wish that we can now move forward with the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Ag","Kenyan capital Nairobi, under the watchful eye of United Nations ambassadors.

According to the BBC, the document concluded with a memorandum saying that ""prompt completion of the peace process is essential for all the people of Sudan"". The actual peace treaty should, according to the pledge, be signed no later than December 31st 2004. While the pledge focuses mainly on the fights between the rebels in the south and the Khartoum-based government in the north, there is also attention for the ongoing crisis in east Sudan (Darfur).

Several aid agencies have criticized the UN for taking a weak stand against the Sudanese government. The Security Council has already signed two resolutions threatening economic sanctions against Sudan if the government does not disarm its troops in Darfur, but, so the BBC reports, the violence is continuing. The civil war in Darfur was sparked in 2003, when insurgents started attacking government buildings. The Arab government in Khartoum subsequently sent troops to the region, which have been reported to mass-violate human rights of the black Africans living in Darfur."
"In anticipation of a Security Council vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the International Criminal Court, Sudan announced today it would reject","any such decision.

The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the French delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week.

Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, ""Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese &amp;mdash; whether he is a rebel or government official &amp;mdash; outside the Sudan: we are totally against it."" In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group ""Justice and Equality of Movement,"" said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace.

Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to human rights abuses in Darfur. Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts.

The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias. It has often been suggested that this qualifies as genocide, and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights."

"Last night, CNN's Anderson Cooper played a chilling police audio tape of a 1991 confession made by the accused killer","in the recent murder of three young women.
The suspect, who has been identified as Joseph Naso, is currently being held without bail on charges that he killed Roxanne Doll and Carmen Colon in California in 1977 and 1993, respectively. He also stands accused of killing 20-year-old Tracy Tafoya in Nevada in 1984.
Naso was arrested last week after authorities found his DNA at the scene of the most recent crime. The body of 26-year-old Katherine ""Kathy"" Cro","of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford. On the tape, John E. Couey is heard admitting to molesting a young girl in her own backyard. For the crime he was subsequently charged, convicted and imprisoned for 2 years.

An accompanying written report by the officer who took the taped confession says; ""Couey admitted that this was not the first child he had ever touched, however, this is the first time he was caught."" The officer continues, ""Couey admitted to molesting his wife's daughter, however, she agreed not to report the incident if he left the house and gave her a divorce, which he did."" CNN was unable to locate Couey's former wife.

The revelation calls into question the way Couey has been dealt with by officials over the years. He spoke on the 1991 tape about how he ""needs help"" and ""wants help"".

Mary Doyle, a Citrus County probation official, said Monday that if they had known Couey was a registered sex offender, they may have been able to keep him away from Jessica Lunsford. Florida Courts do not provide probation workers with criminal backgrounds of their probationers, even in the case of registered sexual offenders like Couey, Doyle said. With that information they might have tried harder to locate him when he failed to report in with probation officials last November. When detectives did finally catch up with him, they learned he had been living across the road from Jessica."

Whilst this was not immediately debated, Senator Bob Brown had asked the Acting Deputy President of the Senate to look into the matter. Later the President of the Senate ruled that the gesture was ""unseemly but not obscene"".

This ruling caused a fierce debate, with Senator Brown saying that McGauran's ""arrogant and disgusting"" actions exemplified the Government's attitude towards its new-found Senate majority, whilst Senator Ron Boswell, the National Party Senate leader, had criticised Brown of hypocrisy, stating that Brown had ""broken every law in Australia"" and ""every law in Tasmania"" (which Bartlett noted as a point of order as being hyperbole).

Senator McGauran then spoke, stating that he ""regretted his actions"". Brown however noted that this was not an unqualified apology. A motion was then put that the President's ruling be dissented from, which debate was set for another sitting. Senator Chris Evans, the Labor Senate leader and Senator Brown had called for McGauran's sacking as Chief Government whip; his National Party superiors have said that they will speak to McGauran about the incident."

It is also a blow right to the heart of the global terrorism that threatens destruction not just in Iraq but in Britain and virtually every major country around the world.""

"Rabies is a disease that has no cure and nearly everyone it infects is dead just two weeks after the symptoms show. And yet,","there are still people who don't take rabies seriously.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says that 59,000 people die of rabies every year. The WHO also estimates that about 16 million people get bitten by dogs each year. Of those, only 32 percent receive post-exposure treatment.
Rabies is caused by a virus that attacks the nervous system. It can be transmitted through saliva or nerve tissue from an infected animal to another animal or human being. Once in the nervous system, the virus","last week a teenage girl named Jeanna Giese was released from a hospital having been successfuly treated. She became the first known person to recover from the disease without vaccination.

On September 12, 2004, Jeanna &amp;mdash; a 15 year old from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin&amp;mdash; was bitten by a bat while attending church. By the time she saw a doctor about fatigue and numbness, it was October 18, and the bat incident was not brought up until several days later. Usually when there is a possibility of rabies, doctors will vaccinate patients: the vaccine has a chance to act before the symptoms appear. In Jeanna's case it was too late to try to vaccinate, and her doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin devised a new treatment. Jeanna was put into a drug-induced coma for a week, and doctors began an intensive treatment to prop up her nervous system until her natural immunity recovered enough to fight the disease.

By surviving and recovering, Jeanna became the only person known in medicine to overcome rabies without a vaccine. She is not yet fully recovered: the effects of the coma are still apparent, and she has difficulty with movement. Yet the doctors believe that she is getting well much faster than they expected, and feel that Jeanna will be able to return to her high school studies, needing only physical and occupational therapy.

The novel treatment is hailed by doctors as promising, but needs analysis and verification on another human. Jeanna's is the sixth case of human recovery from a rabies infection, but the other five people were vaccinated against rabies either before infection, or before the symptoms appeared."

"Margaret Pardoel, mother of the first Australian soldier to be killed in Iraq since the commencement of hostilities, has expressed anger over the","lack of support she and her family have received from the government.
Ms Pardoel's son, Private Jake Kovco, was killed by a roadside bomb on April 21 while serving with the British Army in Basra.
""I feel very let down,"" Ms Pardoel told reporters at Sydney Airport today after returning from Britain.
""The only thing I got from the Prime Minister (John Howard) was a phone call saying he was sorry for my loss.""
She said she had not been contacted by Defence Minister Brendan Nelson or any other member of the","death of her only son, a father of three, who was about to return home to Australia and had been planning a career change. Mrs Pardoel and husband John were devastated by the loss of their only son.

Mrs Pardoel said she opposes the war. ""I think it's just cold-blooded murder. Look at all those young American boys that have been slaughtered,"" she said. ""I don't think this should have gone on ... He said to me one night he phoned, he said, 'Mum there's nowhere to hide here, it's just so dangerous, there's nowhere to hide'.""

Thirty-five year old Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel had been on his last flight when the C-130 Hercules he was aboard crashed north of Baghdad yesterday, killing ten personnel. He was serving with the British Royal Air Force (RAF), to which he had transferred several years ago from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), as Navigator in 47 Squadron Lyneham RAF.

Mr Pardoel had been expecting to return in July to his wife and three children in Australia, where they had recently bought a new house in Canberra.

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, says he is saddened to hear of the man's death.

""I want his family to know, and his friends to know, that he certainly did not die in vain, that this tragic accident occurred - or this tragedy because it may not have been an accident - but this tragedy occurred on a day when 65 per cent of the people of Iraq went out and voted,"" he said."
"Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found","in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana. The discovery is significant because it shows that T-rex had softer bones than previously thought.
The researchers used synchrotron X-ray microscopy to examine the bones and discovered that they were not as hard as originally believed. They also found evidence of blood vessels within the bones.
""We've shown for the first time that these animals did have some kind of vascular system,"" said Dr. Thomas Carr, lead author of the study published in Nature Communications. ""It was very exciting.""
Carr added","in a sandstone formation in Montana.

MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science.

Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. “Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.”, paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Richard A. Hengst of Purdue University said the finding ""opens the door for research into the protein structure of ancient organisms, if nothing else. While we think that nature is conservative in how things are built, this gives scientists an opportunity to observe this at the chemical and cellular level.""

Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said the discovery was ""pretty exciting stuff."" ""You are actually getting into the small-scale biology of the animal, which is something we rarely get the opportunity to look at."""
"Speaking in Texas, President Bush in a Wednesday address to the American Legislative Exchange Council in the city of Grapevine said, ""","I'm not going to let people who want to kill us have access to nuclear weapons.""
""We will use all elements of our national power to confront and defeat this danger,"" he added.
The president also called for an expansion of the U.S. missile defense system, saying that it is necessary to protect America from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea.
""Our enemies are innovating and developing new technologies to threaten us,"" Bush said. ""And we must do the same.""
Bush also criticized Russia for its recent decision to suspend its participation in the 198","The violence in recent days in Iraq is a grim reminder of the enemies we face.""

""After September the 11th, I made a commitment to the American people that the United States of America will not wait to be attacked again."" Bush said. ""We will take the fight to the enemy, and we will defend our freedom.""

There has been debate within the Administration as to how to refer to the ongoing conflict. In recent appearances, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has avoided using the word ""war"", preferring the phrase ""global struggle against violent extremism."" Bush's speech marks a return to the existing phrase ""war on terror"". In the speech he acknowledged that the struggle is against those who use terror to achieve their goals, implicitly recognising that the term ""war on terror"" may be misleading.

""Make no mistake about it, this is a war against people who profess an ideology, and they use terror as a means to achieve their objectives,"" he said.

Of the military strategy in Iraq, Bush said that coalition forces continue to hunt down terrorists, and the Iraqi security forces are being trained to take on more responsibility. ""As Iraqis stand up, Americans and coalition forces will stand down,"" Bush said. ""And we're making progress. More and more Iraqi units are more and more capable of defending themselves.""

The return of American forces to U.S. soil will be event-driven decision, he said. A timetable for withdrawal is not practical because it would give the enemy a tactical event upon which to plan.

Politically, Iraq's National Assembly is working on a constitution that members pledged to have ready by August 15. The Iraqi people would then vote on the constitution October 15. If passed, the new Iraqi government under a constitution would be elected December 15.

"The White House announced the selection of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World Bank, replacing John Wolfensohn who retires as acting president after 1","0 years.
Wolfowitz is a former deputy secretary of defense and has been an architect of U.S. foreign policy in Iraq. He was also one of the key figures behind the invasion of Iraq.
The bank's board will vote on his nomination at its next meeting on May 24. If approved, he would take office June 1.

The choice of Wolfowitz is raising controversy in Europe and developing nations. Known as hawkish and outspoken, Wolfowitz was a pro-Iraqi war neo-conservative in his role as deputy Secretary of Defense, and a chief architect in the build up to war with Iraq. Some question whether Wolfowitz, who was criticized for brushing aside European and NATO calls for caution before the Iraq war, would use the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as tool to extend U.S. foreign policy interests.

Historically, it has been the White House’s prerogative to name the candidate because the U.S. holds a majority on the 24 member board, but board members from nations other than the U.S. are seeking their own interviews to qualify the candidate before a change is made. ""The executive directors have agreed to conduct informal meetings over the coming days with the US nominee as part of the consultative process."" the IMF said in a statement. ""Thereafter, the executive directors will meet in a formal session to select the president at which time an official announcement of the outcome will be made,"" it said. The vote is set for March 31, the same day Wolfensohn retires.

Rob Nichols, the US Treasury spokesperson, said Wolfowitz has begun scheduling meetings with board members and that, ""Our nominee… looks forward to meeting with and listening to members of the World Bank board."" Reuters reported. In the meantime, Wolfowitz has worked to assure those with concerns of him, saying he would come with an open mind and no political program."

"United States President George W. Bush's nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security, Bernard Kerik, has declined to continue through Senate confirm","ation hearings after it was revealed that he had not paid taxes on a nanny who lived with him and his family in New York City.
Kerik is the former police commissioner of New York City and currently holds the position of chairman of Giuliani Partners LLC, which provides consulting services to corporations and governments worldwide. He also serves as an adviser to the Iraqi government.
The White House said Monday that Kerik would withdraw from consideration for the post. ""I think it's best if he steps aside,"" White House spokesman Scott McClellan told repor","ation. In a letter to President Bush, Kerik explained that the immigration status of a housekeeper and nanny, as well as nonpayment of income tax on the housekeeper were his reasons for retracting.

However, Kerik's past dealings may have been the strongest reason for his decision to withdraw from the nomination. Newsweek has uncovered that as recently as 1998, a New Jersey judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kerik following a tangled web of lawsuits relating to unpaid bills on a condominum. Newsday and the Seattle Times have reported that Kerik may have business ties to the Mob and allegations of two extramarital affairs have arisen.

In addition, his windfall profit from stock options in Taser International (i.e. ""Taser guns"") with no apparent investment, has been under heavy investigation. Kerik received a profit of more than USD $6 million after selling his stock in early November, just before an Amnesty International report critical of Taser guns was released. Kerik had joined Taser International's board shortly after resigning as New York City's police commissioner; both the NYPD and Department of Homeland Security have purchased large amounts of Taser's non-lethal electroshock weapons."
Russian researchers warn that Western Siberia has begun to thaw as a result of global warming. The frozen peat bogs in this,"region are now melting, and the resulting methane gas is being released into the atmosphere.
The scientists say that the release of methane from these bogs could be 10 times greater than previously thought. They also warn that the effects of climate change on permafrost will have an impact on the entire world.
""We've found out that the amount of methane emitted by the peat bogs is much higher than we expected,"" said Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ""This means that the effect of global warming on","region may hold billions of tons of methane gas, which may be released into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

Sergei Kirpotin, of Tomsk State University warned New Scientist that the event is an ""ecological landslide that is probably irreversible and is undoubtedly connected to climatic warming"".

David Viner, of the University of East Anglia told The Guardian: ""When you start messing around with these natural systems, you can end up in situations where it's unstoppable"". He also warns that this event was not considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

In May, scientists from the University of Alaska found methane ""hotspots"" in eastern Siberia where the gas bubbles out from thawing permafrost bogs at a rate that prevents the surface from freezing.

The permafrost has been intact for 11,000 years and started melting 3 to 4 years ago, according to Kirpotin.

The Court at Old Bailey in London found that Zardad pursued a reign of fear along his checkpoints and ordered summary executions and torture of innocent civilians. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.

Zardad denied all charges throughout the trials, and claimed he had been set up by enemies in Afghanistan.

""I have never killed anybody and if anybody in the whole of Afghanistan can produce that evidence against me then I will accept that crime,"" he said.

The case is considered to be a landmark in international law. British law allows the prosecution of crimes like torture and hostage-taking in the UK even if no British citizen was involved and the incidents occurred overseas.

"An outbreak of cholera in West Africa has resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people, and United Nations (UN)","officials are warning that the epidemic could spread to other countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that there have been at least 624 cases of cholera reported in Nigeria since August, with 381 deaths. The disease is also present in neighbouring Cameroon, where 17 people have died from it.
""We're very concerned about this,"" WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told reporters in Geneva. ""It's a major problem.""
Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal","health officials are concerned that inadequate health services in the region could result in many more deaths.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that over 31,250 cases of cholera have been reported so far this year in nine West African countries. It has claimed 488 lives at this point. ""If we look at this year's trends, the figures are still going up in many countries,"" said John Mulangu, a senior regional advisor for the WHO. ""If cholera is not brought under control in certain regions, we will soon be talking of... 100,000 cases,"" he said. ""And hospitals and health centres will be overwhelmed. Last year we were not on this scale. The problem is getting worse,"" Mulangu said.

The UN says that the increase could also be related to the fact that due to poverty, many West Africans move around, sometimes out of the country, in order to receive higher wages for their work, and the region has been hit with heavy rains. This helps spread the disease, according to the UN.

""We are about to enter the harvest season where people will be moving around,"" said Herve Ludovic de Lys, the head of OCHA's West Africa office. ""The main goal is to halt the transmission of this disease,"" he said. ""It's not business as usual. This crisis needs a rapid response.""

The following West African nations have all been hit by cholera epidemics: Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Senegal. The WHO issued a statement on Thursday that more countries were at risk. ""Outbreaks are likely to spread to Central Africa - Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad - in the next weeks,"" it said."

Paul Kessler of UNHCR has said that kidnappings and other security problems are still common in Northern Iraq.

Returns to Iraq had been voluntary, but according to The Times around 100 rejected asylum seekers have been arrested and are now in detention.

Demonstrations have been held across the country and are expected outside the Home Office today, 26 August.

The Home Office has not yet commented on the case. They have previously backed down under pressure. Zimbabwean asylum seekers were given amnesty from deportation until October following headlines such as that on the front page of right-wing Daily Mail ""For pity's sake, let them stay""."
"The inflation rate in Ireland, as measured by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), edged upwards to hit a five month high in May at","0.8%. This is slightly above the eurozone average of 0.7% and well below the UK's 2.9% figure.
The CSO said that the increase was due to higher prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages, clothing and footwear, furnishings, household equipment and routine household services.
However, it also noted that there were decreases in the price of transport, recreation and culture, communications and miscellaneous goods and services.
""The annual rate of inflation has been gradually increasing since January,"" commented economist Alan","2.4%. This represents a 0.2% rise on the previous month when the rate stood at 2.2%.

The major contributors to the rise were increased transportation, healthcare, and education costs. In April the EU25 average rate of inflation was 2.1%, with Latvia having the highest rate at 7.1% and Sweden the lowest at 0.4%.

Despite the increase in the rate, Irish inflation remains very low - having hit 7% during 2000 and remaining around the 5% until the beginning of 2003. Another major factor easing any worries about the increase is Ireland's very strong GDP growth - expected to be around 5.5% this year

On an annual basis the cost of footwear and clothing have fallen by 2.7% whilst energy costs have soared by 10.4%. The cost of food, furniture, and communications also fell over the last 12 months.

According to a page at the Gmail Help Center, while not all accounts currently have the formatting features added, ""over the next several weeks, we are introducing rich formatting to all of our users.""

The increase in storage is announced on the main Gmail page with a JavaScript counter that increases the quoted available storage in relation to the current date. For example, on April 1 at 5 a.m. UTC the site announced 1025 MB available, 30 hours later &amp;mdash; 2050 MB, and a week later it should announce a total of 2075 MB.

Oregon State University (OSU) animal researchers in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Dubois,"Agricultural Research Center have developed a new method for studying how animals respond to stressful situations, such as being transported or slaughtered.
The study is published in the current issue of the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science.
""We are using this technique to learn more about how livestock react when they are moved from one location to another,"" said OSU veterinary medicine professor and lead author Dr. David Fraser. ""This will help us better understand their behavior during transportation.""
Fraser and his colleagues at USDA's Dubois Agricultural Research Center in Idaho used",", Idaho-based Sheep Experiment Station released a report on an OSU-USDA study which was initiated in 1995 after breeders asked the government to determine why some rams bought as breeding studs showed no interest in females. The researchers are working under a $2.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in hopes of developing a test which can determine the likelihood of a ram being female-oriented before it is sold as a stud.

By studying difference in the animal's brains after slaughter, the study also showed what could be a biological determiner for what makes a ram male-oriented instead of female-oriented sexually. The scientists' results showed that the anterior preoptic area of the rams' hypothalamus was 50 percent smaller in male-oriented rams as opposed to female oriented rams. A 1991 study of human brains of AIDS victims showed a similar hypothalamus size difference between gay and heterosexual men.

The sheep researchers postulate that low levels of aromatase hormones in the brain of a developing male sheep fetus may have kept the brain from fully masculinizing, leading to sexually male-oriented rams.

""This lends further support to the idea that homosexuality has biological underpinnings,"" Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology, said in an interview with the Corvallis Gazette-Times.

Professor Stormshak believes that ""understanding sexual drives and the continuum of sexual behavior could possibly help explain the scientific basis of sexual assault and put an end to assertions that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."""

Apple Computer has formally acknowledged that the screens on some of its new iPod nano units are prone to scratching and cracking. The company,"said it is working with suppliers to improve the quality of the plastic used in the screen, but did not say when a fix would be available.
The problem was first reported by Macworld magazine last week. Users have posted photos of their broken nano screens on Apple's discussion forums. Some users also complained about problems with the touch-sensitive controls on the device.
""We are aware of reports of a small number of nano displays becoming damaged during normal use,"" Apple spokeswoman Lynn Fox told Reuters. ""We are working closely with our supplier to address this issue","has agreed to replace units with a cracked screen free of charge.

Several customers found that the screens of their brand new iPod nano MP3 players were cracking and scratching easily. According to Tyler Hall the creator of http://www.nanoscratch.com, his iPod nano was scratched within 30 minutes of use in the pocket of his shirt. He posted his concerns to the Apple support forums, but his post was deleted. He created www.nanoscratch.com to allow other users to post comments on the iPod’s “scratchability” and post photos of scratched iPods.

""This is a real but minor issue that involved a vendor quality problem in a small number of units,"" said Apple spokesperson Tom Neumayr. Apple estimates that these issues affected less then 0.01% of the total iPod Nanos shipped.

In most individual cases Apple has been telling customers that the scratches and cracks were covered under warranty. Standard warranties on most electronic products do not normally cover cosmetic damage such as scratches or accidental damage such as cracks. Users with a cracked screen can now contact Apple for a free replacement."

The judicial review was called for under article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees freedom 'to manifest one's religion or beliefs' and which was made a part of British law in 1998. The Convention includes the right to conscientious objection and the campaigners claim that this gives them the right not to pay other people to go to war on their behalf.

Their statement to the court said: ""We want to make a positive contribution to society by paying our tax in full. We object in conscience to paying others to kill on our behalf, but current tax policy forces us to do just that.""

The courtroom had to be enlarged to make room for supporters and the judge listened to the case for three hours.

December 1, 2004—An elementary school in northern California has been testing a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag-based identification program on its 7th and 8th graders. The system, which is being used to track students' attendance at the school, also allows teachers to monitor their class","th grade students since January 18th, 2005. According to the ACLU, this is the first time that public school students in the United States have been required to wear devices that enable automatic identification. RFIDs have previously been used to track students in Japan.

RFID tags contain antennas to enable them to receive and respond to radio-frequency queries from an RFID transceiver, enabling identification of pupils when they are in the vicinity of the detectors.

Each student is required to wear an ID card on a lanyard around their neck. An RFID tag, manufactured by local Sutter corporation Incom, is attached to the card. The school has installed RFID detectors at the doors of seven classrooms as well as the bathrooms, though they claim that the bathroom units were not turned on, and subsequently been removed after complaints from parents.

While some parents have complained about the system, local high school teacher Tim Crabtree told the San Francisco Chronicle, ""It's baffling why so many people are bothered by the district being able to tell them where their kids are at,""

A text message, reportedly sent from the doomed aircraft, has also been revealed as a hoax.

Greek Chief Coroner Philippos Koutsaftis stated ""Until now I have done an autopsy on six bodies and first evidence is that when they were killed they had circulation in their heart and lungs.

""That does not mean that they were conscious but that they had breath and circulation. They had circulation and heartbeat so they were alive.""

Initial reports from the Greek Defence Ministry had suggested the bodies were ""frozen solid"" at the moment of impact.

The coroner stressed that as more post mortems were carried out new evidence may come to light.

Nothing is known about the cause of the disaster beyond the fact that everyone on board the airliner was incapacitated at some point, and that emergency oxygen masks had been used. Speculation abounds, with the theory that the airliner failed to maintain pressurisation at some point being the most popular theory.

Helios has said the aircraft was maintained in line with European regulations and had also received a standard inspection before take-off.

Greek police have also arrested a man who claimed his cousin texted him from the airliner, saying the pilots were blue in the face and that they were freezing. He was brought to the district attorney where two charges were filed against him, for lying to the authorities and for spreading false information, and a trial was scheduled. The man claimed that his intention was to gain publicity.

Police have also attended Helios's offices to requisition documents as part of the investigation into the disaster.

The","match, which started at 10:30am local time (2330 GMT), was scheduled for a 45-over per side contest but only 16 overs were possible before persistent rain forced officials to call it off.

Australia won the toss and elected to bat first on a pitch that had been covered by a layer of grass in an attempt to prevent any further damage from the wet weather.

"The growing power of the Internet is clearly reflected in the decision, announced Tuesday, for the Associated Press to begin charging newspapers and broad","casters that use its news reports.
The AP has been a non-profit cooperative since 1846, when it was founded by newspaper publishers who wanted to share information about the Mexican War. It now provides news reports to more than 15,000 media outlets worldwide.
AP President Tom Curley said the change will allow the organization to expand its reporting staff and invest in new technology. He also noted that many other news organizations have already begun charging their customers.
""We're not going to be able to compete with them if we don't","casters to post wire stories, photos, and other content on their online editions. The changes go into effect January 1, 2006. An advisory committee meeting will be held in the fall to ease the transition.

As the Internet draws more news consumers from traditional repositories of data, increasing numbers are demanding the stories on the Internet reflect the quick updating and coverage of a large wire network such as the Associated Press.

The rates the AP charges, known within as “assessments”, have risen by about 2.75 percent annually during the 90’s. Since the service is supposed to be not-for-profit and is owned by its customers, price increases are a tough sell.

The formula for the new calculations still has not been set, making it difficult to determine how the changes will affect what the outlets charge for their online news coverage. Currently the AP bases rates on newspaper circulation or broadcast audience with the large ones footing the major part of the bill.

The AP is creating a computer database of news paraphernalia which includes stories, photos, graphics, audio and video. It is all designed to make it easier for news rooms to create usable content."

Rescuers are searching for the victims of the Tans Peru airliner crash which occurred earlier this month. Emergency services rescued ,"12 people from the wreckage, but there were no survivors.
The plane was carrying 90 passengers and crew when it went down in a mountainous region near the city of Juliaca on February 14th. The cause of the accident is still unknown.
""We have to find out what happened,"" said Peruvian President Alan Garcia. ""It's very important that we know why this tragedy happened.""
The aircraft was flying from Lima to Puno, a tourist destination in southern Peru. It disappeared from radar at an altitude of 36,0","5 survivors on Thursday morning.

TANS say that 41 people were killed and a further 57 injured in this, the fifth airliner crash worldwide this month. The Boeing 737-200 airliner crash-landed in heavy jungle near the city of Pucallpa, 840 kilometers (522 miles) northeast of Lima, the capital city.

Peruvian authorities have ordered an investigation and have shipped the aircraft's two flight data recorders, or ""black boxes"" to the United States for data retrieval.

Jorge Belevan said ""We've also found five more survivors and that takes the number (of survivors) to 57. Two people are still missing and there are 41 dead,"" Local authorities also said that the death toll is likely to rise due to inaccessible location of the crash site. This is the second TANS Peru plane crash in three years, following the January 2003 crash of flight 222 in the Peruvian rainforest. In that plane crash there were no survivors.

Peruvian government lawyer Marco Ochoa said that rescuers are opening the skin of the aircraft to determine whether there are more bodies trapped inside.

Survivors said that the plane was caught in a fierce storm about 10 minutes before the crash. The plane then caught fire and landed in swampland."
"A small single-engine ultralight aircraft has crashed on a lawn between the Reichstag building, the seat of the German parliament, and","the government district in Berlin.
The plane was carrying two people when it went down shortly before 10am local time (08:00 GMT) on Wednesday.
One person died at the scene while the other was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
German media say the pilot is believed to have been an experienced glider pilot who had flown for many years.
He reportedly told air traffic controllers that he was having trouble controlling his aircraft.
""We are currently investigating what happened,"" said police spokesman Jens Thurau. ""It's too early","the Bundeskanzleramt, the seat of the chancellor, in Berlin. The aircraft crashed at approximately 2000CET. Amateur footage aired by the ARD shows the plane rapidly descending before crashing on the lawn and bursting into flames. Witnesses at the scene were inconclusive about the heading of the plane. Some stated that it was targeting the Reichstag while others said that the pilot tried to steer away from it. He was killed in the crash. People near the scene attempted to fight the fire with hand-held extinguishers, however the aircraft was mostly destroyed by the time the emergency services arrived.

The German authorities have ruled out terrorism. Police are saying that the pilot's wife has been missing since Monday and they had suspected that he might have something to do with the disappearance. It is possible that he might have committed suicide to avoid prosecution."
China and the European Union agreed to unblock 80 million pieces of Chinese textiles impounded at European ports. The deal was announced during a one,"-day visit by Premier Wen Jiabao to Brussels, Belgium.
The agreement is expected to help ease trade tensions between Europe and China. It comes after months of talks over how to handle the huge stockpile of clothing that has accumulated in Europe since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.
China's exports to Europe have grown rapidly in recent years, but many European companies say they are losing money because of low prices set by Chinese manufacturers.
Earlier this year, the EU threatened to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese","-day EU&amp;ndash;China summit in Beijing by Tony Blair, prime minister of the United Kingdom, which is currently holds the EU presidency, and Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.

According to the agreement, 50% of the impounded clothing will be allowed into the EU unconditionally, while the rest will be counted against 2006 quotas.

Today's deal ended the so-called European&amp;ndash;Chinese ""bra wars"", which have split the EU member states: those with a strong retail sector support the agreement, while those with large clothing industries want to set up a protectionist policy against China.

The agreement now must be approved by the 25 EU members.

"Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced an Inquiry into the ""very regrettable incident"" of a mentally ill Australian woman being detained for","10 days in a Japanese jail.
The inquiry will be headed by former High Court Justice Michael McHugh and is expected to report back within three months.
Mr Howard said he was concerned about the treatment of Ms Yee, who suffers from bipolar disorder and depression.
""I am very concerned that she may have been subjected to conditions which were not appropriate,"" Mr Howard told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday.
""I'm also concerned at the way this matter has been handled.""
Ms Yee, 34, was","months and allegedly maltreated by the country's own Immigration Department.

The woman, Cornelia Rau, still insisted she was German Anna Schmidt, according to her sister Christine yesterday. ""I think it will take a long time for her to stabilise,"" she said. ""At the moment she doesn't accept that she is Cornelia and she doesn't want to see us.""

""She is still insisting her name is Anna Schmidt and that her passport is in Baxter and that she wants to return to Germany.""

Refugee advocate Pamela Curr claims Ms Rau was held in isolation for 18 to 20 hours a day in Baxter's 'Red One' isolation facility, where she was allegedly kept in simulated daylight for 24 hours a day.

Her family had only discovered her whereabouts through a refugee-initiated effort to identify the woman, authorities having failed to connect the unidentified detainee with her missing person file, held by New South Wales Police since August last year.

After her family recognised media reports of her on Thursday, and contacted the police, her photo was emailed to the Baxter compound and her identity confirmed.

The schizophrenic woman had spent six months in a Queensland prison, according to Channel Nine News, as well as at least two months in immigration detention, according to various sources. Earlier reports had her being handed over to immigration authorities over 10 months ago, with only five days spent in custody with Queensland Police.

Ms Rau is presently recuperating in hospital."
"Mo Mowlam, the former Secretary for Northern Ireland, has died at 8.10am BST (07:10 UTC)","on Friday 19 August 2005 after a long battle with cancer.
She was born Margaret Doreen Mowlam in County Durham, England, and educated at St Aidan's High School, Newcastle upon Tyne. She studied law at the University of Northumbria before working as an industrial relations officer for the National Union of Public Employees. In 1974 she became a member of the Labour Party.
Mowlam worked as a solicitor from 1976 to 1983, when she joined the staff of the then-leader","in a hospice after a fall two weeks ago. She was 55.

In a statement, prime minister Tony Blair called her ""one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered. She was a natural politician, could read a situation and analyse and assess it as fast as anyone.""

Another former cabinet minister, Clare Short, said: ""She was a very beautiful young woman, she survived ill health and helped bring peace to Northern Ireland and now she's gone far too young.""

Mo Mowlam was central to the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and was popular in Britain for her straightforward approach, informality and honesty.

Ms Mowlam even received a standing ovation during prime minister Blair's speech during the 1998 Labour Party Conference.

Mo Mowlam retired from political life in 2001, but continued to make the headlines by realising her autobiography which was critical of Blair's presidential style of government.

It is thought that the fall that made her go to hospital, and then the hospice where she died, was due to a lack of balance caused by a brain tumour."
"A new giant panda cub has been born at the San Diego Zoo. Bai Yun, a 13-year-old giant p","anda who is one of only three females in the U.S. to have given birth to twins, gave birth to her third set of twins on Saturday.
The two male cubs are doing well and will be named later this week. The first set of twins were born last year and are now living with their mother at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong National Nature Reserve. The second set of twins was born in December 2009 and are currently being hand raised by keepers at the San Diego Zoo.
Bai Yun's previous","anda, gave birth at 9:57 p.m. on Tuesday to a cub weighing four ounces (113.5 grams).

""Bai Yun immediately tended to her squawking infant,"" said Suzanne Hall, a panda research technician at the San Diego Zoo who observed the births of Bai Yun’s other cubs in 1999 and 2003. The cub is the second to be born in the United States this year. In Washington, Mei Xiang gave birth to a male panda cub at the National Zoo last month after artificial insemination.

According to Hall, early ultrasound images indicated Bai Yun was pregnant with twins. However, zoo personnel became suspicious that one fetus was no longer viable after veterinarians failed to detect a heartbeat in one cub last week. Bai Yun failed to give birth to a second cub Tuesday evening. ""It is likely that the second fetus died in utero and was reabsorbed by her body,"" Hall said.

Panda behavioral researchers will be watching the pair 24 hours a day for three weeks to record and assess the mother-infant relationship. The new cub has not yet been named. The gender of the cub will be unknown until zoo staff can safely check."

The Nobel Peace Prize winner was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1908. He received his doctorate from the University of Warsaw in 1934 and worked as a researcher at the Polish Academy of Sciences until he fled to England during World War II.

In 1946, he resigned from the project and began work with the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission","Nuclear Arms Race, has died at the age of 96.

Born in Poland in 1908, he graduated from Warsaw University.

Rotblat formed the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs organization in 1957. The group promoted nuclear disarmament and greater collaboration between scholars from all over the world to try and prevent major global conflict.

In 1995, Rotblat and the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, ""for their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.""

"Sami Mohammad Ali Said al-Jaaf, also known as Abu Omar al-Kurdi, accused of many bomb","ings in Iraq.
The US military has captured a top leader of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), which is linked to Al Qaeda and blamed for numerous attacks on civilians and security forces in Iraq.
US officials said that the man was arrested by American troops near Baghdad's airport on Wednesday. He is believed to be one of the most senior leaders of ISI, which is led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, an alleged terrorist who is wanted by the United States.
""He is a very important figure","ings, has said to have been captured by US and Iraqi security forces. He was arrested on the 15th of January, but his arrest has not been revealed until now.

Al-Jaaf was said to have been a threat to security because of his ties to the militant group Zarqawi and his previous criminal record. Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's party offices were close to the site of the recent bombing in Baghdad, these bombings were claimed by Zarqawi supporters on their website, but, luckily, Mr Allawi was not in the area at the time of the blast, which happened on Monday."
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palesinian President Mahmoud Abbas today declared an end to military and violent activities against each other,".
The two leaders signed a document in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik, which also calls for Palestinians to disarm militant groups. The agreement is expected to be followed by further talks on the future status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
""We have decided that there will be no more violence between us,"" Mr. Sharon said at a news conference after signing the deal with Mr. Abbas. ""There will be no more terrorism.""
Mr. Abbas called the accord ""historic."" He added: ""I hope this is the beginning of a new",". The two leaders made the expected announcement at a summit held at Shram el-Sheikh, Egypt, the first such meeting between the two sides in four years.

Prime Minister Sharon pledged to end military operations against Palestinians, and President Abbas similarly said that the Palestinians will likewise end ""all acts of violence against Israelis....wherever they are"". Both leaders expressed hope that the agreement will lead to long term peace in the long-running conflict. Prime Minister Sharon said that the agreement is part of the goal of ""quiet, dignified and peaceful lives for all the nations in the Middle East"". President Abbas said ""the calm that is currently prevailing in our territories signals the start of a new era, the start of a hopeful peace."" Both sides also confirmed their intent to create an independent Palestinian state. The talks became possible in the renewed optimism after the death of Yassir Arafat and the election of Abbas.

The agreement marks a profound change in Israeli-Palestinian relations, but the negotiated truce is a shaky peace. The ability of President Abbas to exert control over Palestinian militant groups is questionable, and thorny political issues remain for the Israelis if they begin to withdraw settlers from the occupied territories. There are signs that the Palestinian resistance groups are willing to participate in the cease-fire: the terrorist organisation, HAMAS released a statement in the hours before the summic stating that ""was prepared to calm down resistance raids in the event the Zionist entity reciprocated,"" referring to Sharon's pledge to stop military activities, yet shortly after the summit a spokesman for the organization said it will not be bound by the cease-fire.

The agreement includes a pledge by Israel to release 900 Palestinian prisoners, to create join committees on prisoner release and the withdrawal of troops from Palestinian territories, and cooperation with Palestinian security forces in occupied areas."
"The Israeli High Court has unanimously ruled that the controversial wall separating Israel from the West Bank should be rerouted.

","The court said it was satisfied with a new route proposed by the government, which would move 10% of the barrier away from Palestinian land and into Israel.

The decision is seen as a victory for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to build a security fence along the border between Israel and the occupied territories.

The original route had been criticised by human rights groups who say it violates international law.

Israel says the barrier will prevent suicide bombings in its cities.

Palestinians have called it an ""apartheid wall"".","The panel of nine justices gave their ruling on a petition submitted by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and ordered that alternative routes be investigated around the settlement of Alefei Menashe. The court ruling orders that the existing wall in the area be demolished and rebuilt nearer to the settlement.

The rerouting of the wall will result in the Palestinian village of Qalqilya, and four others, being on the West Bank side of the barrier.

The barrier has been a contentious issue between Israelis and Palestinians since construction began. Israel's government ignored last year's non-binding ruling by the International Court of Justice which declared the barrier illegal."

"The state owned telephone monopoly in Costa Rica, the Costa Rica Electricity Institute, (ICE) has called for VoIP Internet to be made","illegal.
The ICE is concerned that VoIP will reduce its income from phone calls and it wants the government to pass a law banning VoIP services.
The ICE said that VoIP was not regulated by any authority and could lead to fraudulent activities such as identity theft. It also claimed that VoIP would cause problems with emergency services.
However, the ICE's call for VoIP to be outlawed has been met with opposition from other groups including the Costa Rican Chamber of Commerce.
""We are against this initiative because we believe that it is an attempt","a criminal offence. In Costa Rica it has been illegal for anyone other than ICE to offer telephone services. With a reputation for preventing any rivals from challenging its monopoly, but also for providing an efficient service, ICE has recently seen its monopoly dented with as many as 20% of calls being routed through Skype and other VoIP service providers.

On the other hand those who seek to promote the software industry in Costa Rica, which already has a dominant 78% share of the market in Central America and the Caribbean, have reacted by saying the proposal would be disastrous both to software development and the country's ability to outsource work. The ICE claims that its telephone structure is being used by VoIP service providers, which is almost certainly true given that Skype offers calls from the Internet to phones in Costa Rica for 8 US$ cents per minute."

The BBC reported on January 27 that statistics released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health showed that Coalition forces killed 60% of the,"civilian population in Iraq.
The report was based on a study conducted by Johns Hopkins University and published in the British medical journal, The Lancet. It concluded that at least 100,000 civilians have died as a result of the war.
The BBC also quoted Dr. Les Roberts, one of the authors of the study, who said: ""We estimate that there are about 100,000 excess deaths due to violence since the invasion.""
The BBC's report is not only false but it is also an insult to the intelligence of its view","civilians that died in the period July 2004 to January 2005.

The figures, normally available only to the Iraqi cabinet, show a total of 3,274 Iraqi civilians were killed and 12,657 wounded during the continuing conflict. These figures exclude the deaths of known insurgents.

However according to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, the BBC misunderstood the matter. According to the previous story from BBC these figures were a result of Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces military operations.

However, the Iraqi Ministry of Health explained that the published figures also include Iraqis killed by terrorists, not only those killed by Coalition forces or Iraqi security forces; and that those recorded as killed in military action included terrorists themselves, and Iraqi security forces.

The BBC recognized their error and apologized in a recent news item, and retracted the conclusions drawn by their original report:

""The BBC regrets mistakes in its published and broadcast reports yesterday,"" reported the BBC.""

The figures, based on records from Iraqi public hospitals released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health, are shown in the following table:

Shortly before the release of the figures by the BBC, US Ambassador John Negroponte had told BBC reporter John Simpson:

""My impression is that the largest amount of civilian casualties definitely is a result of these indiscriminate car bombings."""

""I would like to express my feelings of deep remorse over the past history,"" he said, according to a transcript provided by his office. ""We must never repeat such a thing again.""
Koizumi's comments came as Japan is seeking closer ties with China and South Korea in order to counterbalance its growing economic relationship with North Korea.
The prime minister also called for greater cooperation between Asia and Africa, saying that both regions have suffered from poverty and disease.
""African countries are facing many difficulties including poverty, hunger and dise","aggression in the 1930s and 40s.

""In the past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility,"" after this Koizumi added that the Japanese people have ""feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology.""

Koizumi's apology was the first apology offered by a Japanese leader for its country's past in the presence of such a large number of government leaders from different countries."

This is the last scheduled walk for the Expedition 10 crew.

At 06:25 UTC, the two astronauts left the station from the Pirs DC1 docking compartment/airlock and proceeded to install the last three of six space-to-space communication antennas for the ATV's rendezvous and docking with the ISS next year.

Sharipov next deployed the foot long, 11 pound Russian Nanosatellite, tossing it into space by hand. The object of the experiment is to develop small satellite control techniques, monitor satellite

The two astronauts next proceeded to the aft end of the Zvezda service module. A Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna and necessary cabling for the ATV was installed and the men worked their way back to the airlock.

The station maintained its attitude, despite the loss of a gyroscope earlier in the space station mission, until the end of the spacewalk. Chiao and Sharipov reported being a safe distance from the attitude adjustment thrusters. Russian ground control activated the jets and normal attitude of

The New Zealand Labour Party announced its party list admidst speculations it may call an early election. The election must be held before Sept 24,", when the current parliamentary term expires.
The Labour Party is currently in opposition and has been since 1990. It was last in government from 1984 to 1990.
Labour leader Phil Goff said he would not lead his party into a snap election if it meant losing seats. He also said that he did not want to go to the polls until after the next budget on May 26.
""I'm not going to put my own personal ambition ahead of what I think is best for the country,"" Mr Goff told reporters.","2005. The list ranking is often seen as a ranking of the importance for each politician to the party.

Hon. Parekura Horomia was ranked at number five, the highest ranking of any Maori MP. The Maori MPs face a strong challenge from the newly formed Maori Party. Shane Jones, the highest placed non-MP, is all but assured of a seat in the next Parliament. Steven Ching is placed at 42, and represents Labour's interest in courting the Asian vote. The Asian population has grown significantly over the past ten years within New Zealand.

The surprising absentee is Hon. George Hawkins, the Minister of Police. He has been criticised for performing poorly in the House, and it is speculated he was offered a low ranking and refused. He is likely to return to Parliament on the basis of his strong hold on the Manurewa electorate seat.

Volunteers began a 60 day bed-rest marathon on March 19 to study simulated weightlessness effects on women astronaut,"s. The volunteers will be confined to their beds for the next two months, and will have to endure constant noise from air conditioning units in order to replicate conditions of space flight.
The research is being conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, Texas. It is part of NASA's Human Research Programme which seeks to understand how humans react to long periods of time in space.
""We are studying the effect of microgravity on female astronauts,"" said Dr. Michael Barratt, chief scientist for human health and performance at NASA'","s. The study, Women International Space Simulation for Exploration(WISE), is conducted at the MEDES Space Clinic in Toulouse, France.

The 12 women, selected from 1600 applicants hailing from France,Great Britain, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic began the study after a 20 day screening for baseline comparison data as the study progressed.

The women will conduct all activities from eating, bathing, and reading while lying in hospital beds tilted headfirst at a six degree angle. This particular position, called head-down tilt bed rest was determined from previous studies to remove the vertical load of gravity on the body, inducing changes similar to what astronauts in a genuine weightless environment experience .

Long term exposure to weightlessness creates a number of physiological and psychological problems in astronauts such as:
*Reduced capacity for physical exertion
*Muscle atrophy
*Affects of confinement and isolation
*Impaired circulatory function

A total of 24 women will participate in the study. A second group of 12 will join in September.

Three groups of eight women each will be studied over the course of the two campaigns of bed rest. One group will serve as a control, receiving no specific treatments, the second will exercise, while the third will receive nutritional supplements.

The study is designed to fill in gaps of knowledge on the differences between men and women during extended weightlessness. It also aims to develop countermeasures for reducing the debilitating effects of long spaceflights.

Participating agencies in the study include the European Space Agency, NASA, the French Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency."

"Vladimir Putin has relieved from power Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the head of the Russian navy. This comes a month after an incident","in which two nuclear submarines collided with each other and sank.
The presidential decree was published on the official website of legal information on Friday. The document does not specify the reasons for dismissing the admiral.
Kuroyedov was appointed to his post in 2013. He previously served as deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy. In 2014 he became the first deputy chief of staff of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia.
In April this year, two nuclear submarines collided with each other near the port","where 7 Russian sailors became trapped in a submarine, and had to be rescued with help from abroad.

No reason was given for Kuroyedov's dismissal, although Admiral Eduard Baltin speculated on Moscow Radio that it may be because of the navy chief's poor health. According to Reuters, he told Ekho Moskvy: ""He has been lying in hospital for two months, he had a complicated operation.""

Admiral Kuroyedov was in charge of the navy during the Kursk disaster of 2000, in which 118 sailors died when their submarine sank. Kuroyedov is being replaced by Vladimir Masorin, who was previously serving as the Chief of staff for the Russian Navy.

In remarks Putin made about this leadership change and referring to Masorin, he said ""The recent exercises, including those I have attended, show that the navy is developing and that is certainly your merit to a large extent."" Putin also added ""at the same time, there were difficult events, tragedies, but I would like to underline once again that with all these problems, all these tragedies, the main thing is that the Navy is undergoing a revival.""

Masorin added while in a hall at the Admiralty, ""One thing is clear — to continue in the condition which we are in and do nothing is simply not possible. I have been given the task of stopping the navy shaking public opinion. I am not experiencing euphoria at being appointed head of the navy. I understand the level of responsibility on my shoulders."""
"The European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty on April 13
The President of Romania, Traian Băs","escu, has announced that the European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty on April 13. He said this during a meeting with the Prime Minister of Italy, Romano Prodi, who is currently in Bucharest for an official visit.
""I have just spoken to Mr. Prodi and he told me that the European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty on April 13,"" said the President of Romania.
Romania's Accession Treaty was signed by the country's Foreign Affairs Minister, Mircea Geoana, and","escu, met yesterday with Jonathan Scheele, the head of the European Commission's Delegation to Bucharest, as well as with several European parliamentarians (MEPs). The parties discussed Romania's accession to the EU, which is particularly important as the Accession Treaty is scheduled to be signed late this month, after being voted on by the European Parliament on April 13.

Băsescu told the delegation that European integration remains Romania's first priority at the moment, and that after negotiations were closed with the EU in December 2004, accession became a matter of internal politics rather than foreign affairs.

The MEPs talked to Băsescu about public opinion regarding EU accession in Romania, as well as the impact of accession on the rural population. Judging from recent polls, the overwhelming majority of Romania's population approve EU accession, even though this may be partly due to the fact that many of them have not been adequately informed of the costs of accession. The parliamentarians also discussed the environment and the situation in neighbouring countries, especially Moldova. Tourism was also discussed in the context of promoting Romania's image to European Union citizens.

The delegation also discussed with Băsescu a key issue in Romania's accession process: judicial reform. The Romanian President told the MEPs that Romania has taken bold steps to reform its judiciary and fight corruption. There is also progress towards forming an anti-corruption department within the Internal Ministry of Romania.

As part of Romania's foreign policy, Băsescu also said that, once a member of the European Union, Romania would act as an advocate for other Southeastern European states wishing to join the organisation, as well as seeking to attract public attention to the broader Black Sea region. Romania and Bulgariaare the most advanced countries in Southeastern Europe in terms of EU integration, and will therefore be the first countries in this region to join the 25-nation bloc."
The Romanian Government has made plans and identified its aims for the next privatisation program which will end in 2006. By the,"end of this year, it is expected that the first two companies to be sold off will have been selected.
The government's plan is to sell off at least one company from each sector: energy, transportation, telecommunications, banking, insurance, industry, commerce, tourism, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, healthcare, education, culture, sport, etc.
""We are not going to repeat the mistakes of the past,"" said Prime Minister Adrian Nastase. ""We want to make sure that we do everything right.""
The government has already set up an inter-minister","end of next year, the government hopes to sell all of its shares in Romtelecom, Romania's largest telecommunications company, which is currently owned by Greece's OTE but which the government maintains a 47% share in. The full privatisation will occur in two phases, with some of the government's existing shares being sold on the Bucharest Stock Exchange this year, and the remainder being sold in 2006.

By 2006, the government also wants to sell its share in Postelecom, another telecommunications operator, and complete the privatisation of the Radiocomunicaţii, the national radio communications company.

The Government also wantes to begin analysis and consulting into the privatisation of Poşta Română, or Romanian Post, the full privatisation of which is set to be completed by 2009 at the latest.

Romania has embarked on a quite comprehensive program of privatisation since 2000, having privatised a part of Romtelecom, as well as full privatisations of several energy distributors and the nation's largest banks, in addition to other smaller companies. However, these privatisations are dwarfed by that of Petrom, Romania's national oil company, which was bought by Austria's OMV in 2004 and is the largest Romanian privatisation ever.

The current Liberal-Democrat governing coalition in Romania has privatisation and economic liberalism as one of its main policies, having also introduced a 16% flat tax rate for personal income and corporate profits at the start of 2005."
"At University of California, Berkeley on Thursday, researchers and technical workers formed a strike against what they call ""bad faith bargaining""","by the university.
The union representing 1500 technical staff at UC-Berkeley has been without a contract since July 2016. The union says that the university is refusing to negotiate in good faith over wages and benefits.
""We're not asking for anything outrageous,"" said union member and employee of 34 years, John Hickey. ""We just want to be treated with respect.""
Hickey was one of about 100 people who gathered outside the campus's Doe Library to protest the lack of progress in negotiations. He","within the UC system. The Coalition of University Employees (CUE) labor union estimates that around 10,000 university workers are on strike. Other strikes related to this are occurring at UCSF Medical Center, UC Santa Cruz, and four other UC campuses around the state.

The Coalition of University Employees accuses top UC officials of ignoring the union's requests regarding the high turnover rate of researchers. CUE organizers say the university is misleading the union about the quantity of money readily available for employee salary increases.

The UC officials deny accusations that they have bargained in bad faith, saying they have offered a contract to the researchers that's similar to an approved deal.

The fate of the journalists in the past few days has been quite underreported in the Romanian media, as the deadline for their killing has passed yet President Traian Băsescu said this Monday that he knows ""for certain"" the three are alive. The terrorists which kidnapped them aired a tape on Al-Jazeera, on April 23, that they would kill the journalists by April 27 if Romania does not withdraw its 860 troops from Iraq. Romania declined to withdraw the troops, and it seems the terrorists did not enforce their deadline.

The vote was 57-40, with one abstention. The bill now goes to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for his approval.
Sharon is expected to sign it into law on Sunday.
Israel Radio reports that the government will pay $12 million in compensation to each of the 8,600 families living in the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank settlements slated for evacuation.
The money will come from a special fund set up by the government last year.
The radio says the government also plans to give an additional $30","from the Gaza Strip. Eight thousand Israelis will be evacuated from the Gaza Strip and four settlements in the northern West Bank removed.

MKs voted 59&amp;ndash;40 to approve a series of measures that will compensate the settlers who face relocation under the plan, with five abstentions from Arab MKs. Prime Minister Sharon's Likud party was split, with 18 MKs voting for it and 17 against.

The $1bn plan will now go before Sharon's cabinet on Sunday, where it is expected to be passed. After that, the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip could begin this summer.

However Sharon's government faces collapse if his budget is not passed by the Knesset by the end of March. If that deadline is not met, elections will be called and the plan may well be stopped.

Samsung announced it will market DVD players capable of playing back both Sony's Blu-Ray and Toshiba's HD DVD next,"year.
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced that it has developed a new lineup of high definition (HD) DVD players, which are expected to be available in the first half of 2007. The new lineup includes two models: one with an internal hard drive for storing movies and another without a built-in hard drive. Both models support playback of both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD formats.
""We have been working closely with our partners to develop products that meet consumer needs,"" said Hyunsuk Kim, president of Samsung Digital Appliances Division. ""","-generation optical storage formats, if the two camps refuse to compromise on a single format. Assuming development is successful, consumers could expect to see such a device on store shelves next year.

Blu-Ray and HD DVD are projected to be the successor formats for current DVDs. Samsung, while leaning towards the Blu-Ray camp, hopes it can cover both bases by distributing a player with dual-compatibility. While this means spending more in development to unify the two technologies and develop a cost-effective production method, dual compatibility may pay off for the company if the formats challenge each other as VHS and Betamax did twenty-five years ago. Despite the support for Blu-Ray, Samsung has also been supportive of a unified standard to avoid such costly competition.

HD DVD offers single layer capacity of 15GB, more than triple the size of standard single layer DVDs, and benefits from similarities with current DVDs, such as cheap production and compatibility with current DVD players. Blu-Ray can hold 23GB on its smallest single layer version, and is reported to have superior durability and interactivity over current DVD-based technology and HD-DVD. HD-DVD is currently promoted by Toshiba, NEC, Sanyo and Microsoft; while Blu-Ray's base of support is the Blu-Ray Disc Association, which is led by Blu-Ray developers Sony and Philips. It is notable that Sony and Philips, who developed the Blu-Ray format, also competed against the Toshiba-designed SuperDisc DVD standard, which is the standard that is followed today.

The first Blu-Ray and HD DVD products are expected to start appearing in mainstream markets within the next year."

The head of Dinamo's board of directors, Alexey Fedorychev, is among the wealthiest Russian businessmen and he is responsible for making the money available to the club. Another Dinamo transfer target is the Greek footballer Seitaridis, also playing for Porto, but this deal has not yet been confirmed.

Meanwhile, in a Russian Premier League match Saturday with Amkar Perm Dinamo Moscow suffered its fourth defeat in a row 1-2, dropping to 9th place. Amkar (one of the poorest teams in Premier League) on the other hand, won the second match in a row. Despite conceding an early goal, Amkar was able to fight back, score from a penalty and secure a slender lead to win the away game.

Despite numerous signings between seasons and hiring a new coach, Oleg Romantsev, Dinamo's performance is far from the best. Last season saw them at 14th place (out of 16), barely avoiding relegation, and the start of a new season isn't promising either. It is yet to be seen, whether the new signings can help the club join the ranks of the top RPL teams, such as Lokomotiv Moscow and CSKA Moscow."
"Irish low fares airline, Ryanair, this week celebrated its 20th birthday. Having reached the milestone, the airline prompt","ly announced that it would be celebrating by increasing passenger charges and reducing staff numbers.
The company has also been accused of breaking competition rules in a number of European countries. The EU Competition Commissioner is currently investigating whether or not Ryanair has broken anti-competition laws in Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said: ""We are going to have to cut our costs further."" He added that he expected the airline to make an operating profit of €1bn (£750m) for the current financial year.
""I think","ly used the opportunity, as always, to sell seats; launching a massive 200,000 seat sale at 99p/99c a seat.

The airline was founded in 1985 by the Irish businessman, Dr Tony Ryan. It began its existence flying a small 15 seat aircraft between Waterford and London Gatwick with the small aim of breaking the duopoly on London-Ireland flights, held at that time by British Airways and Aer Lingus. Today however, the airline now flies to over 200 European destinations with its fleet of 84 Boeing 737's and is awaiting the arrival of a future 225 aircraft from Boeing.

The company today carries as much as 3m passengers a month (depending on the season) and has revealed it made a profit of €245m (USD$307,916,000) in the past year. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated that the airline will carry over 70m passengers annually within five years. The notoriously eccentric Mullingar man went on to tell the press ""The very fact that a Mickey Mouse Irish airline can start in a field in Waterford 20 years ago and in 20 years overtake the world's self-styled, self proclaimed favourite airline is testament to the almost unstoppable demand for low airfare travel around Europe.""

To demonstrate the huge drop in airfares over the last year, the company claimed while the price of a Ryanair seat had dropped from £99.99 in 1985 to 99p today, the price of a pint of beer had trebled and the average house price in England had increased by 500%."

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it has been informed by the Colombian government about this situation.
""Venezuela expresses its solidarity with the family of the abducted woman,"" says the note.
Urbina's mother was kidnapped on January 25 when she went to visit her son at his farm in the department of Meta.
The FARC guerrillas have demanded $ 10 million for her release.
The former baseball player, who played for the New York Yanke","of Colombia (FARC-EP) commander Alvis Patiño, known as El Chiguiro. Urbina is a Venezuelan and a Major League Baseball right-handed closer who plays for the Detroit Tigers.

Chiguiro has been captured on February 2005. A delegation of authorities from Colombia was sent to Venezuela, so he could be identified. Now, after his identification, Colombian officers expects he can be extradicted to Colombia. In Colombia, Chiguiro is expected to be judged for the alleged crimes of kidnapping and murderer of the American missionaries Sthephen Everet and Thimoty Dike in 1995.

Some Venezuelan baseball players from the Major Leagues said that kidnapping is a new situation they must learn to live with. None of them said that the risk of kidnappings would prevent their return to Venezuela.

For years, Venezuelan cattlemen near Colombian borders say that they are victims of extorsion by FARC forces. This is the first time that the Venezuelan government recognizes that the FARC is responsible by this kind of crime in Venezuela.

According to the Colombian authorities, Chiguiro is envolved with the exchange of drugs by weapons with Brazilian traffic drug dealers."
Pope John Paul II has been re-admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital with a relapse of influenza which saw him hospitalised earlier,"this week.
The Vatican said the 84-year-old Pontiff was admitted on Friday evening and would be kept under observation for at least two days.
""He is in good health,"" it added.
Pope John Paul, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, had been due to celebrate mass in St Peter's Square on Sunday but cancelled because of his illness.
His last public appearance was on Wednesday when he celebrated mass in the chapel of the Gemelli hospital where he was being treated.
The Pope has suffered several bouts of flu since","this month.

He was wheeled into Gemelli Hospital on a partially elevated stretcher, and was waving to people as he entered the clinic.

Later, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls announced that the pope had undergone a tracheotomy to assist his breathing.

The Pope's re-admittance again raises questions about how long his papacy will last. One of his close aides refused to rule out the possibility of the Pope retiring saying it was up to his ""conscience"". The Pope has recently indicated that he has no intention of retiring by saying that the call ""to guard his flock"" was ""particularly alive in him"".

The operation lasted around thirty minutes, and Navarro Valls said to media that it was a success."

In a scene repeated across much of America, each morning a group of day laborers, mostly immigrants, assemble by a 7-Eleven convenience store in the hopes of getting work.

Each day, nearly 200 people gather near the nation's capital in Herndon, Virginia; these laborers do much of the hard and dangerous work not wanted by most U.S. citizens. This daily gathering has drawn both the ire and compassion of the Herndon community. A public hearing Monday night to discuss a new plan drew an overflowing crowd to the Town Council chambers. The Commission said so many people signed up to speak at the hearing that the panel will need to convene again Tuesday night.

For years groups and businesses among the community who want to help the day laborers have been working on the issue. In a plan spearheaded by Bill Threlkeld, of the group Project Hope and Harmony, they lobbied Herndon officials to use taxpayer money to build a regulated day laborer center in an old police station at the edge of town. This they say would get the day-laborer group(s) off the street. The plan has the backing of Herndon mayor, Michael L. O'Reilly.

The plan would also combine the opening of the center with a new local ordinance that would make it a misdemeanor crime for a laborer to seek work at any location other than the official one. Opponents of the plan say the town would be aiding illegal immigrants if it established the center.

A Pew Hispanic Center survey found a 25% increase over four years in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The number now is estimated to have reached about 10.3 million. Local governments do not have the authority to enforce national immigration laws, so the town of Herndon must rely on federal officials, who show little interest in getting involved."
Helsingin Sanomat reports images circulating over the Internet that purport to show male conscripts being sexually abused and humiliated,"by their superiors.
The newspaper said it had received a number of emails with photos showing men in military uniforms, some naked or wearing women's underwear, apparently being forced to perform sexual acts on each other.
One photo shows a soldier kneeling before another who is holding his penis. The caption reads: ""This is how you do your job.""
Another image shows two soldiers standing next to each other, one of them naked from the waist down. A third photo shows a soldier sitting on a chair while another stands behind him and inserts something into his anus.",", which turned out to be a prank. They allegedly show conscripts masked and with gas masks over genitals.

In the images, released through Internet forums, soldiers are humiliated by their officers, being forced to act like dogs with other soliders holding their leashes. The Defence Forces communications director Ossi Kervinen considers the matter unfortunate.

The images are strikingly similar to those that came out of the Abu Ghraib prison last year.

Finland has a policy of neutrality, with a requirement of conscription for all men between the ages of 18-30 for 180 to 362 days. However, they can opt to do civil service work instead, which lasts 13 months."
U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema accepted would-be hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui's guilty pleas on,"Tuesday, but she delayed sentencing until May 24 to give prosecutors time to decide whether they want to seek the death penalty against him.
Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent, was arrested in August 2001 after he tried to take flying lessons at an airport near Minneapolis. He is accused of conspiring with al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and others to kill Americans using planes as weapons.
The government has said it will seek the death penalty for Moussaoui if he is convicted by a","six charges of conspiracy laid against him for his plotting to participate in the Sept. 11 attacks. Moussaoui, who had to be restrained at one point during the trial in an Alexandria, Virginia courthouse, was polite and quiet during the day's appearance.

36-year-old Moussaoui, a French citizen, faces the death penalty or life in prison in the sentencing phase of his trial. The prosecution has also asked that Moussaoui be forced to pay restitution to the victims of the attack.

19 hijackers took control of four planes on September 11, 2001. Nearly four weeks before the attack, Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota on immigrations charges having raised the suspicions of instructors at a flight school.

During the attack, two planes were flown into the World Trade Center buildings, a third struck the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, USA."

Qatar Airways, which choose the Airbus A350 over Boeing's 787, will also purchase 20 of Boeing's larger 777 planes for $4.6 billion. Qatar has a previous order for 2 of Airbus' massive new A380's which it will begin to fly in 2009 out of London Heathrow.

In 2004, Airbus sold more planes than Boeing for the first time ever, sparking questions whether the US company had lost its once seemingly impregnable grip on the aviation market. However thus far, Boeing has received far more orders than Airbus in 2005."
"The Italian government has criticized the Swedish public service broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT) for their recently launched campaign called ""Fri Television"". One","of the commercials in the campaign shows a woman who is being raped by her husband.
""The commercial is shocking and unacceptable,"" said Italy's foreign minister, Franco Frattini, to the newspaper La Repubblica.
""It is not acceptable that a public television station should show such a thing.""

"As they have done for the last four years, United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientists were measuring an approximate 100 square","mile area of the San Andreas Fault in California.
The USGS has been studying the fault since 2004 and is using a technique called seismic reflection to measure the depths of the fault. The method involves sending sound waves into the ground and then recording how long it takes them to bounce back. This allows researchers to determine the thickness of the rock beneath the surface.

""What we're doing is mapping out the structure of the crust.""","mile bulge in central Oregon near the South Sister this past August. The bulge is located 25 miles outside of the city of Bend, Ore. and three miles from the South Sister.

The results of this years survey won't be available for some weeks, but geologists have come to some conclusions based on the past four years of monitoring. The intial discovery was made by using information from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Interferometric Satellite Aperture Radar satellite. Scientists believe the bulge is rising at a rate of 1.4 inches per year and is due to a large lake of fluid (likely magma) that is 4.5 miles below the surface. They also think the fluid covers an area about one mile across and extends to a depth of 65 feet. The pooling fluid could be shifting magma or the creation of a new volcano.

Ground swells aren't an extraodinary occurrence in geology. Geologists suspect that these ground swellings occur in the Cascade Range and at other volcanoes, and the majority of them do not lead to eruptions. Using the same ESA satellite technology, geologists have seen lots of bulges in the Aleutian Islands that have not lead to eruptions."

The company also plans to introduce the Airbus","arest, the Romanian capital, to Arad, a city in the country's west, will be cancelled, due to lack of financial viability and an increase in competition. The reason for the cancellation is mainly due to the planned inauguration on May 16 of a Bucharest-Arad flight operated by the private airline Carpatair, Romania's second-largest airline.

Carpatair has grown very quicly in the past two years, adding several new destinations, both in Romania and abroad. Also, it has taken away many of TAROM's customers on international routes because it provides direct connections from Transylvanian cities such as Arad and Timişoara to German and Italian cities, saving customers the task of changing flights at Bucharest. Also, although Carpatair started out as a Transylvanian airline, it now also flies to destinations in Romania's east, and is expected to open up new routes via Bucharest, in a further attempt to compete with TAROM and win more market share.

The first trial ended in a mistrial after one juror received a threatening letter. Nancy Salomon says of the second trial that the ""Defense was counting on the jury not reaching a verdict; they had used their challenges during the jury selection process to kick almost every potential juror who had a college degree, or had any business experience or Wall Street experience off the jury ... they were hoping that this case was just going to be too confusing for the jury."" While the jury did take 11 days to arrive at their decision, they found Kozlowski and Swartz guilty on 22 of the 23 counts. To combat the aggressive jury selection strategy undertaken by the defense, the prosecution ""basically gave the jury several credit hours worth of an MBA"", teaching them about following paper trails and detecting falsification of business records. It paid off during deliberation as the jury requested over 100 documents to review.

Kozlowski and Swartz directly stole approximately $150 million USD from Tyco and acquired $430 million more by inflating the company's stock value and then secretly selling company shares. Bail was set at $10 million each. The two former executives face a minimum of eight years in prison, up to a maximum of 25 years. In addition, Kozlowski is accused of evading $1 million in sales taxes on six paintings that he bought in 2001 in a separate New York State case, and Swartz faces tax evasion charges in New Hampshire.

""We are developing a new controller that takes advantage of the capabilities of the Wii U hardware to create a brand new experience","for the company's new Nintendo Revolution console. Resembling a television remote, the controller uses two sensors placed near the user's television to triangulate its position in three-dimensional space. This will allow players to control actions and movements in video games by moving the device through the air.

The remote control design is said to target new players who are unfamiliar with traditional video game controllers.

A supplementary peripheral has also been shown, consisting of a separate plastic grip that is designed to be held in the player's second hand. It provides an analog stick and two trigger buttons, and connects to the bottom of the main controller with a simple cord. Additionally, Nintendo has suggested that the main controller will be able to slide inside a ""shell"" that will allow it to function like a conventional video game controller.

The Revolution is expected to be released next year.

A World Health Organization (WHO) committee comprising of 43 African health ministers has declared a tuberculosis emergency on the,"continent.
The declaration was made at the end of a two-day meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which discussed ways to fight TB and other infectious diseases.
TB is one of the world's top killers with an estimated 10 million new cases every year. It kills more people than any other infectious disease.
""TB is not only a major public health problem but also a developmental challenge,"" said Dr Luis Gomes Sambo, WHO regional director for Africa. ""It affects productivity and economic growth.""
TB is caused by b","continent.

The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in African countries per year has quadrupled since 1990, and continues to rise. Now 540,000 people die of the disease in Africa every year.

Worldwide, TB kills two million people a year; the only deadlier disease in the world is HIV/AIDS.

Some African countries such as Tanzania and Malawi pioneered TB control strategies that were later adopted around the globe. But they were not successful - Malawi saw the number of TB cases a year rise by four times over the past 15 years. Poverty, poor health systems and HIV have been blamed by the WHO for this.

Funding is a particularly critical issue. Eight of the nine worst affected African countries reported that, for 2003, they had short-falls in the funding their TB control programmes needed. However the WHO stresses that money alone will not end the crisis - health systems must be improved, and the rate at which health professionals are lost in the region must be reduced.

Africa is the only region in the world to be experiencing an increase in TB cases - in the rest of the world, infection rates are either stable or falling."

Meanwhile, Ramallah has accused Lebanese rebel group Hezbollah of attempting to sabotage the fragile peace agreement in the Middle East. The group, backed by Syria and Iran, are attempting to recruit Palestinian militants to engage in attacks of Israeli targets, claim Palestinian spokesmen. The charges mirror those made recently by Israel, which has long accused Hezbollah of bankrolling Palestinian violence in the region.

Hezbollah denies the charges, and claims to be honouring the ceasefire agreed yesterday. However, Palestinian officials claim to have intercepted bank records and email communications that prove that the guerilla group is recruiting militants in the West Bank. Abbas is shying away from any confrontation with the group at the moment, but has sent an envoy to Beirut to persuade Hezbollah to desist from its aggressive activities.

Despite the setbacks, Israel has begun to lift restrictions of travel and issue permits to 1000 Palestinians to work in Israel, as part of Tuesday's deal. Sharon has agreed to travel to Ramallah to continue talks toward peace in the region."

A studio audience contained equal numbers of National and Labour Party supporters.

The debate ran through tax, race relations, foreign affairs, immigration, education and health (all the key policy areas).

Taxes were at the top of the agenda; the debate was just hours after the National Party released their tax policy.

Don Brash said that the nuclear freeze policy of New Zealand (which bans nuclear powered US warships from its ports) and Helen Clark's criticism of the war in Iraq have both contributed to her failure to secure a free-trade pact with the United States.

Helen Clark was confident and aggressive and she often forced Don Brash into defensive explanations of National's policies."
"New mass grave was discovered in a cave in Klina region, Kosovo. According to UNMIK's report, the remains are probably of non","-Albanians killed during 1998-1999 war.
The new findings were made by an international team led by Dr. David Hicks from University College London and Dr. Ian Banks from the University of Bradford. The team has been working on the site since last year.

"Guidant Corporation recently announced another safety warning on several models of its implantable defibrillators, cautioning users for the second time in","less than a year. The company is recalling 10,000 devices that were manufactured between April and July 2005 because they may not be able to deliver life-saving shocks when needed.
The recall involves certain versions of the ICD-3000 series, which are implanted under the skin to monitor heart rhythms and provide an electrical jolt if necessary. The device has been linked to at least two deaths since it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004.
Guidant said the problem","a week about the devices. No patients are known to have been injured by the devices at this time. This brings the total number of defibrillator models recalled to twelve.

According to the Associated Press article, the five defibrillator models recalled ""have a magnetic switch that can become stuck in a closed position, preventing the device from treating irregular heart rhythms. The faulty switch also can limit a defibrillator's battery life.""

American manufacturing giant Proctor &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) plans to acquire Gillette Co. for US$5,"7 billion in stock, the companies announced on Friday.
The deal will create a company with combined sales of $60 billion and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $12 billion. The new company would have 34 brands that generate more than $1 billion each in annual sales, including Pampers, Tide, Crest, Duracell, Olay, Wella, Max Factor, Head &amp; Shoulders, Old Spice, Safeguard, Vicks, Folgers, Pringles, Bounty, Charmin,","7 billion in stock. The purchase plan calls for P&amp;G to swap 0.975 shares of its stock per share of Gillete Co. P&amp;G also announced a stock buyback program in which they would purchase up to US$22 billion of shares over the next 18 months. Including the stock buyback program, the merger is being financed by 60 percent stock and 40 percent cash.

P&amp;G is known for brands such as Ariel and Tide washing powder, Max Factor cosmetics, Pringles potato crisps (chips) and Hugo Boss and Lacoste perfumes.

Gillette, known for brands such as Gillette razors, Oral B dental care, and Duracell batteries, has had growing problems with the growth of private labels and price cuts demanded by large supermarkets.

After the acquisition is completed, Gillette's CEO James Kilts will be P&amp;G's vice-chairman. Kilts said that he expects that this acquisition will cause additional mergers to take place.

""I believe the consumer product industry needs to consolidate,"" said Kilts, ""we believe we can bring these companies together and create a juggernaut.""

P&amp;G and Gillette have a combined market capitalization of about $185 billion US, which will make it the largest in the sector.

The early morning announcement states that 6,000 employees will be eliminated. Most of the layoffs will result from reducing overlapping management positions and other supporting positions within the combined company.

Antitrust regulators in the US and Europe plan to review the acquisition, to determine whether the combined company will have too much power over pricing and shelf space.

P&amp;G plans to provide additional details about the merger Friday morning (East Coast time) in New York."
Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was officially placed under house arrest a day after the country's Supreme Court upheld his,"detention.
Pinochet, 90, has been held at Santiago's military hospital since he was arrested on October 16 in connection with the disappearance of two leftist activists during the 1973-1990 rule of the former general.
The court ruled that Pinochet should remain in custody while prosecutors investigate whether he ordered the killing of the two men.
""We are satisfied,"" said Juan Guzman, one of the lawyers representing the families of the missing men. ""It is an important decision.""
Guzman said","indictment of one count of murder and nine counts of kidnapping.

Court officials say the arrest order was delivered to Gen. Pinochet's home near the capital, Santiago, Wednesday. The 89-year-old retired general has been at his home recovering from a stroke he suffered in late December.

A government commission, the Rettig Commission, listed 2,095 deaths and 1,102 disappearances during his 17-year rule. In 2004 the Valech Report that was issued after interviewing an estimated 35,000 people who claimed to have been abused by the regime; 28,000 were regarded legitimate.

The crimes were allegedly committed as part of Operation Condor, a campaign of assassination and terrorization meant to suppress left-wing opposition to Pinochet's regime. The Chilean-led program soon spread to other military regimes throughout Latin America, and may have had at least tacit complicity by then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The Pinochet dictatorship ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990, gaining power after a military coup overthrew the democratically-elected socialist President Salvador Allende."
"Berlin's Neukoellner Opera House is causing a stir with its new production, The Yellow Princess.

The story presented in the","opera is based on the life of Empress Elizabeth of Austria (1837-1898), who was known as Sissi to her family and friends. She was the only daughter of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and his wife, Queen Sophie. Her father died when she was 15 years old, leaving her mother to rule over the Austrian Empire until her own death in 1867.

As a result, the performers smoke cannabis joints on stage, and the theatre itself is encouraging the audience to join in.

Artistic director Bernhard Glocksin says that the theatre is claiming the metaphorical ""artistic licence"", to excuse the actions of the actors and audience, which are against German law. Glocksin was quoted by Ananova as saying opera would be ""improved with a few joints and some appetising lines"", noting the production was partly an experiment, to see what they could ""get away with.""

""Artistic licence"" is at par to an ""artistic liberty"", where something is exaggerated or changed for the sake of the art itself.

Chinese media and former ROC President and spiritual leader of the pro-independence TSU Lee Teng-hui (李登輝,") have been criticized for their comments on Taiwan's future.
The China Times yesterday quoted a report by the state-run Xinhua News Agency as saying that ""the people of Taiwan are not ready to accept independence."" The paper said that it was ""unrealistic"" for the island to declare independence, because such a move would be opposed by the international community.
""Taiwanese society is still far from being ready for independence,"" the report quoted Wang Yi (汪毅), director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing University, as saying.
Wang also",") responded on Monday to the massive rally held Saturday in Taipei.

In mainland China, the China Daily published an editorial under the headline, ""March sets stage for secessionist scheming"" in which it labeled the rally as ""secessionist scheming"" and a ""misuse of people power"".

China Daily said of President Chen that, ""his participation in the protest added to his record as a man of bad faith. Only one month ago, Chen solemnly pledged to develop cross-Straits relations during his meeting with PFP chairman James Soong. Unfortunately he has failed to honour his word.""

In Taiwan, former President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) asked for the ROC government to follow up on the large turnout with concrete measures.

The Taipei Times quoted Lee, ""The March 26 march ended perfectly, yet it wasn't just the close of a political carnival."" Lee continued, ""It was a new starting point for consolidating people's identification with Taiwan and declaring the Taiwanese people's strong will to defend their right of self-determination.""
""That 1 million Taiwanese people came out was a display of the mainstream of Taiwanese public opinion, and officials should respond to that with practical actions and policies,"" Lee told a symposium. ""Otherwise the march will just have been emotional venting, which won't solve the current cross-strait problems.""

"The new leader of Togo, the late president Gnassingbé Eyadéma's son, Faure Gnassingb","é, has been sworn in as President.
The 35-year-old was elected by parliament on Thursday after his father died last week aged 69.
He is expected to face a tough challenge from opposition parties who have called for fresh elections.
Mr Gnassingbé won 80% of the vote in the first round of voting earlier this month.
His main rival, Jean-Pierre Fabre, withdrew from the race before the second round, saying he did not want to be seen as ""a spoiler"".
Mr Fabre had accused Mr","é, pledged to hold ""free and transparent elections which reflect the will of the people"" as soon as possible, though he did not mention a specific timeframe, nor did he address international criticism of his ascession to power.

Togolese politics have become a subject of criticism by the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations after the death of Eyadéma late last week. Eyadéma was Africa's longest-ruling leader whose 38-year rule was marked by government-sponsored violence and the stifling of political expression.

The Constitution of Togo was amended to permit Eyadéma to retain power, to allow more than two five-year terms in office, and to lower the minimum age for a president from 45 to 35. The latter move was seen as a way to allow the succession of the presidency to Eyadéma's son, then only 35 years old.

When Eyadéma died on Saturday of a heart attack, the country's Constitution called for power to be transferred to the head of the national assembly. Instead, Faure Gnassingbé assumed power and the Constitution was amended to allow this, causing criticism from foreign commentators.

Faure Gnassingbé also promised reforms, and an open dialog with the opposition parties. However, with the opposition leader out of the country since an assassination attempt in 1992, and the presidential term not set to expire until 2008, it is not clear how much change these promises will bring in the near future."

She said that if elected, she would focus on","next Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS).

The post became available after the previous Secretary General, Miguel Ángel Rodriguez, served for only 24 days of his term of office, before returning home to Costa Rica to face corruption charges.

Luigi R. Einaudi, the former Assistant Secretary General, is serving as Acting Secretary General until the OAS decides who will serve for the remainder of the current term of office.

Before Menchú was nominated, the Central American states had decided that the candidate should be from Central America. But the Rodriguez scandal has made it difficult for the Central American states to find another candidate they could all endorse.

Chile and Mexico have proposed their own candidate for the job.

President Oscar Berger of Guatemala agrees that Menchú should be the Central American candidate. Menchú has said that if the Central American nations are in agreement, she will happily stand as their candidate.

An indigenous Guatemalan, Menchú won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, and was also prominent in her opposition to the previous FRG government which Berger defeated.

Menchú works for the current government as Good Will Ambassador for the 1996 peace accord.

The judges are untrained citizens elected by their peers.

The 1994 Rwandan genocide was an eruption of ethnic conflict where Hutu militia, supported by the Hutu dominated government and encouraged by 'hate radio', attempted to ethnically cleanse the minority Tutsi. Despite numerous warnings the international community did not take serious action to prevent the atrocities, which included hacking people to death with machetes, and forcing people into buildings that were then destroyed with bulldozers. Estimates place the number killed at up to one million."
The US Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah is looking for a subcontractor to produce the anthrax bacill,"us, which will be used in tests of vaccines and treatments.
The contractor must have experience with producing the bacteria at industrial scale, according to an announcement on the Federal Business Opportunities website.
Dugway has been testing anthrax vaccines since 1954, when it began using the original version developed by the US government. It currently uses a licensed version produced by Emergent BioSolutions.
The new contract will run from 2018 until 2023, with options that could take it through to 2027","us anthracis Sterne strain in 1,500 litre quantities. The Sterne strain is not thought to be harmful to humans, but the intended use of the anthrax remains unclear, worrying anti-biological weapons activists. Other recent Dugway contracts for equipment to produce unspecified biolgical agents in 3,000 litre batches are even more concerning to activists.

The contracts were uncovered by The Sunshine Project, a group opposed to biological weapons development based in Germany. The work involved seems to cast doubts on the ability of the US to live up to its commitments to the Biological Weapons Convention. The post 9/11 anthrax attack upon the U.S. used weaponized U.S. Army anthrax , most likely produced at Fort Detrick.

A Dugway spokesperson declined to specify what the biological agents would be used for."
"A month after the Cook County Board of Commissioners unanimously voted to welcome the 2006 Gay Games to Chicago, the five Republicans","on the board have decided they don't want them.
The commissioners are asking for a vote by their colleagues to rescind the resolution that welcomed the games and asked the county to help with planning. The vote is scheduled for Wednesday.
Commissioner Tony Peraica (R-Riverside) said he was concerned about the cost of hosting the event. He also questioned whether the games would be good for tourism in the city.
""I think it's going to be very difficult to get people from all over the world to come here,"" he said. ""It","on the board withdrew their names under pressure from conservative activists. Chicago is located in Cook County.

The Gay Games is an Olympics-style multi-day international sports competition targeted to LGBT athletes.

Commissioners Gregg Goslin, Liz Gorman, Carl Hansen, Tony Peraica and Peter Silvestri, the only Republicans sitting on the Board of Commissioners withdrew their names from the proclamation. ""I'm a pro-family kind of person and conservative on social issues. That's nothing against the gay and lesbian community, but it's nothing I want to advance as a cause celebre,"" Peraica told the Chicago Sun-Times. In the same report, Gorman said that she doesn't support ""special rights for any group.""

An anti-gay rights lobbying group, the Illinois Family Institute (IFI), says it is trying to get Democrat commissioners to also withdraw their names from the official welcome. ""There is a difference between tolerating and celebrating homosexuality,"" Peter LaBarera, a spokesman for the group said in an Associated Press interview. The IFI also expressed concern about taxpayer money being used to promote the event.

Although Gay Games spokeswoman Tracy Baim she said she was not surprised by the reversal of the five commissioners, Mike Quigley, a Democrat Cook County Commissioner said of the retraction of his colleagues, ""It's a blinding bias and animosity that is overriding human interest, job creation, economic development and the whole spirit of athletic competition."" Quigley was the sponsor of the proclamation and plans to play ice hockey in the games.

The 12 other commissioners who voted for the welcome proclamation maintained their support for the event, which is scheduled to run from July 15 to July 22, 2006 and projected to generate between $50 million and $80 million in tourist business to the city and county."
"Yesterday, the United Nations Security Council said it would take all steps necessary, including the implementation of individual sanctions, in order to ensure that the resolution","s on North Korea are fully implemented.
The UN Security Council has unanimously adopted a new resolution against Pyongyang for its nuclear test and missile launches. The resolution was drafted by Japan, the US and South Korea. It is the ninth resolution since 2006.
North Korea's ambassador to the UN, Han Tae-song, told reporters after the vote that his country will continue with its nuclear program. He also warned that if the US takes military action against North Korea, Pyongyang will respond with ""all means at our disposal.""","s of the Security Council were adhered to by both sides of the troubled Ivoiran peace process. The remarks followed a briefing to the Security Council by representatives from the UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire and African Union-appointed South African mediators.

""The South African Mediation stated that it will continue its efforts, with the support of the United Nations and the African Union, to ensure the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in Côte d'Ivoire as scheduled, which is the only solution to the crisis,"" the Security Council said in a statement following the meeting.

The next round of elections are scheduled for the end of October although it is widely believed this date is unlikely to be met.

The peace process in Cote d'Ivoire has been on shaky ground following the failure of the rebel forces to begin the disarmament process originally scheduled for 31 July. The rebels, led by the Forces Nouvelles, claimed that Ivorian President Gbagbo had failed to make the necessary legal reforms necessary to begin the disarmament. The international community later ratified the legal changes made by the Ivorian government as being in compliance with the peace deal."
Canadian military officials are being accused of covering up the use of the deadly chemical agent Agent Orange and other defoliants during the 1950,"s in Vietnam.
The accusations come from a former member of Canada's Department of National Defence, who claims that he was ordered to cover up evidence of the use of Agent Orange by Canadian troops in Vietnam.
""I was told not to talk about it,"" said retired Col. Jim Phelps, who worked for the department between 1968 and 1972. ""It was very clear.""
Phelps is one of several veterans who have spoken out against the government's refusal to acknowledge its role in using Agent Orange and other herbicides during the","s and 1960s at a New Brunswick base.

At a public meeting attended by at least 200 people, defence officials said only a small amount of the herbicide was used, over a total of seven days between 1966 and 1967 at the army base to clear foliage to prevent fires during artillery training and to clear the view for soldiers.

The American military was also given permission by the Canadian military to test Agent Orange, Agent Purple, and Agent White during the Vietnam War on less than 500 acres of the Canadian base.

Thursday’s public meeting followed in the aftermath of recent media reports that a U.S. army report indicated the use of Agent Purple, which is considered three-times more toxic than Agent Orange, as part of the spraying program.

When revelations about the use of Agent Purple first surfaced in mid-June, retired sergeant, Earl Graves, said, “They were out in the exercise area and the planes flew over spraying and they were told to just put ponchos over their head, that it wouldn’t hurt them.”

He said 170 soldiers in his regiment died of cancer and many of them died young.

At the public meeting held Thursday afternoon, angry and fearful civilians and veterans voiced fears that the chemicals were responsible for illnesses later developed.

Veteran John Chisholm said soldiers were told the sprays were harmless and to keep their mouths shut. “Now we found out this stuff here is killing us. No wonder all my buddies are dead.”

The Defence Department said Thursday that it was conducting tests to determine the dioxin level in the soil and consulting with the U.S. military to find out the exact carcinogen levels in the sprays used."
"WASHINTON D.C., USA – (Washington Post) A Washington Post report reveals a secret intelligence department created by the Pentagon ""","to monitor and influence public opinion abroad.""
The program, called Operation Earnest Voice, is run out of the Defense Department's Psychological Operations unit, which has been renamed the Strategic Campaigns Center. The center was established in 2005 to coordinate information operations for all branches of the military.
""We are not going to sit back and let our nation be portrayed in an unprofessional or inaccurate manner,"" said Col. Wayne Shanks, director of the Strategic Campaigns Center. ""We will do everything we can to counter that.""","directly responsive to tasking from Secretary of Defense"" Donald Rumsfeld. The report raises questions regarding the legality of the Strategic Support Branch, allegations disputed by Pentagon spokesperson Lawrence T. DiRita:

: ""...the Department is not attempting to 'bend' statutes to fit desired activities, as is suggested in this article.""

Sen. John McCain (R AZ) expects the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee to hold hearings on the issue. ""I'm always sorry to read about things in The Washington Post when they affect a committee that I am a member of.""

Members of congressional intelligence committees were reported as not being aware of the program. Funding of the program was through ""reprogrammed"" funds, without explicit congressional authority or appropriation."
"To help launch Cape Verde's first public university, the Brazilian government has made the promise to provide organizational advice and to train professors.","The new institution will be called Universidade de Cabo Verde (UCV) and is expected to open in 2015 with a student population of about 3,000. The UCV will offer courses in medicine, engineering, law, economics, education, social science, humanities and natural science.
""We are very happy that we have this opportunity,"" said Pedro Pires, president of Cape Verde. ""It is an important step for our country.""
Pires was speaking at a ceremony held on Tuesday in Brasilia, where he signed a memorandum of understanding","

According to Fernando Haddad, Brazilian Minister of Education, Brazil will send its professors to the small nation off the African coast to train them in lecturing, marking, and other important skills involved in the profession.

Filomena Martins, Cape Verdean Minister of Education and Human Resource Enhancement, met with Haddad on August 22 to work out the details of the plan, which was first launched by Brazil's President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in July 2004.

Cape Verde also hopes to increase the level of education for the university professors themselves. Of the 300 professors at the planned institution, only 3% have doctorates and only 21% have master's degrees.

Brazil also helps Cape Verde reduce its debt through the Post-Graduate Student Agreement Program. PEC-PG encourages Cape Verdeans to become foreign exchange students in Brazil. In 2005-06, 20 students will participate, with the level increasing to 50 students in the next calendar year."
"In an interview by John D. O'Connor for the American magazine Vanity Fair, it was revealed that W. Mark Felt, a former","deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), is the infamous Watergate source known as ""Deep Throat"".
The revelation came in response to a question from Vanity Fair editor-in-chief Graydon Carter about whether or not he had ever met with Felt. The answer: Yes.
""I did meet him,"" said Carter. ""And I can tell you that he is absolutely convinced that he was Deep Throat.""
Carter also told CNN that he has spoken with Felt on several occasions and that he believes his story.
""He'","associate director of the FBI during the Nixon Administration, was the anonymous informer called ""Deep Throat"". ""Deep Throat"" helped journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bring down then-president Richard Milhous Nixon through the exposure of the Watergate scandal.

Previously bound by a pledge not to reveal ""Deep Throat's"" identity until after his death, Woodward and Bernstein at first refused to confirm the Vanity Fair report. However, in a story posted late today on the Washington Post website, they verified that Felt was ""Deep Throat.""

However, one of Richard Nixon's biographers, Jonathan Aitken, believes that at least one of ""Deep Throat's"" tips could not have been known by Felt. The Post first reported on the famous 18 1/2 minute gap in a crucial tape at a time when only six people were aware of its existence -- none of them Felt. This raises the possibility that ""Deep Throat,"" though mainly based on Felt, may be a composite character.

Felt has been mentioned as a leading candidate for ""Deep Throat"" by many that have tried to solve the mystery. An article published in the American Journalism Review last fall claimed Carl Bernstein's son once exposed Felt as the mysterious informer. But until now, Felt, Woodward, Bernstein and the Post's former editor Ben Bradlee have all denied it.

Felt, 91, has reportedly been in poor health in recent years. His family says Felt admits to being the source and described him as feeling proud of his role in history and having ""a big grin"" when told of the Vanity Fair article."
An insurgency involving approximately 40 to 60 fighters at Abu Ghraib prison base was repelled by the Iraqi,"Army and U.S. forces, according to a statement from Multinational Force Iraq.
The attack began around 1:30 p.m. local time when ""a group of terrorists infiltrated the compound,"" said Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, spokesman for Multinational Forces-Iraq. The attackers were armed with small arms and grenades, he said.
""They attacked the guards stationed there and then attempted to take over the facility,"" Garver said. ""The Iraqi army responded quickly and decisively.""

The conflict, described as intermittent and lasting an hour, involved two car bombs, rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire. Officials in Baghdad reported approximately 20 U.S. service members and 12 prison detainees were wounded. According to the Colonel the attack occurred at 10 a.m. EST.

US forces responded with heavy weapons fire and eventually brought the situation under control. There are no reports how many insurgents were wounded or killed in the battle.

Governmental inquiries
A public inquiry is a form of judicial inquiry","deeply controversial.

The processes and terms of reference of such 'Public' Inquiries are normally determined by the commissioning governmental body. However the Internet has now made possible the emergence of a new type of Public Inquiry, called an ""E-Inquiry"" that appears to be not only independent of government but also, like a Wiki, enables anyone who wishes to partake in the Inquiry to do so by contributing evidence and by posing questions that contribute to the process of determining the Terms of reference of the E-Inquiry.

The absence of a US government sponsored independent public inquiry into the Katrina hurricane disaster could well be the spur that led to the development of a new non-profit web site that incorporates a framework for conducting a Public E-Inquiry. That site http://www.ForumKatrina.org carries the banner line ""Katrina Support, Recovery, Planning &amp; E-Inquiry"".

The web site owners have given permission to quote the following extract from its statement on the web site about the objective of its E-Inquiry:

""Everyone who may think of getting involved in the E-Inquiry is asked to remember, at every stage in the process, that the end purpose of the E-Inquiry is to provide recommendations, for the future. The objective of those recommendations is to help everyone to avoid death, disease and destruction in consequence of forthcoming natural and man-made disasters. If those recommendations are to be taken seriously, and this, the first E-Inquiry, is to acquire any public credibility, then the process must be democratic, patently fair and intellectually rigorous.""

It will be interesting to see whether an E-Inquiry is capable of meeting these ideals and whether they become a common feature of internet activity."
"After a year-long investigation, a committee has found that Kofi Annan, head of the United Nations, failed to halt corruption in the","oil-for-food program.
The report by the U.N.'s internal watchdog agency said Mr. Annan should have done more to prevent abuses and should have acted faster when he learned about them. The report also criticized his top deputy for not doing enough to stop the misuse of funds.

The oil-for-food program was set up after Iraq was forced out of Kuwait in 1990.","Oil for Food program, which was supposed to provide food to impoverished Iraqi citizens.

According to Paul Volcker, head of the Independent Inquiry Committee, ""Our assignment has been to look for mis-or mal-administration in the oil-for-food program and for evidence of corruption within the UN organization and by contractors. Unhappily, we found both.""

The report emphasized that Annan knowingly allowed Saddam Hussein to continue making huge unethical profits off of the program.

While Annan acknowledged that there was blame to pass around, he stated that ""None of us -- member states, Secretariat, agencies, funds and programs -- can be proud of what it has found."" Annan also says that he was at least partly at fault for the corruption; ""The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism.""

On a lighter note, while the report is critical of Annan, it also says that the Oil for Food program did help get food to many Iraqis."

A controversial patent directive has been thrown out in a landslide vote. 648 MEPs out of 680 voted today,"to reject the proposed changes, which would have made it easier for companies to get software patents.
The European Parliament's legal affairs committee had already rejected the proposals last week, but they were put back on the table by the full parliament. The vote was held after an intense lobbying campaign from both sides of the debate.
""This is a victory for common sense,"" said Joe McNamee, executive director of European Digital Rights (EDRI). ""It shows that when citizens and organisations speak up against bad laws, their voice can be heard.""
""We are very pleased with this result,"" added","to reject the proposal, aimed at bringing Europe in-line with a similar U.S. bill.

""This is a great victory for those who have campaigned to ensure that European innovation and competitiveness is protected from monopolisation of software functionalities and business methods.

Adversaries to the patent directive claim that a bill covering Intellectual Property (IP) would ""stifle innovation"" in Europe, as it allows the patenting of implementation within software.

The Accession Treaty, which is due to be voted by the European Parliament on April 13 and signed on April 25, is the legal document facilitating Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the EU, which, according to the treaty, will take place on January 1, 2007.

The treaty's content has been posted online in order to inform Romanians of the costs, standards and responsibilities of European Union accession. The text was published after the European Commission asked for Romania and Bulgaria to better inform their citizens of what EU accession actually means. Bulgaria similarly made available the content of the treaty, in the Bulgarian language, in early April.

Once the Accession Treaty is signed, Romania and Bulgaria will have to withdraw from the Central European Free Trade Agreement, as they will be integrated into the EU-wide free trade area. Additionally, from April 25, the two countries will send observers to the European Parliament and will be able to participate in other European Union institutions and events as observers.

When the two countries join in 2007, the European Union will have 27 members in total and more than 480 million citizens. The timetable for accession, and the implementation of the treaty, however, will be in jeopardy if the European Parliament fails to approve the accession of the two countries on April 13, or if the two countries are deemed unprepared for accession by the European Commission, in which case the so-called safeguard clause will come into effect, postponing accession by one year."

"Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has dismissed the Minister of Housing, Alice Mobolaji Osomo, as part","of a major cabinet reshuffle.
The president also appointed Mrs. Osomo's deputy, Mr. Titi Omo-Ettu, to replace her in the ministry.
Mr. Obasanjo said he was satisfied with the performance of his ministers and that they had done well.
""I am satisfied with their performance,"" he told reporters at State House on Thursday evening. ""They have done very well.""
He said the new appointments were necessary because some of the ministers had been in office for too long.
""It is time for them to move","of an on-going anti-corruption drive to clean up Nigeria's world image.

A statement from the president's office said Mr. Osomo was sacked after the sale of public property violated instructions. According to a BBC report, the Minister allocated more than 200 properties to top officials rather than going on public sale.

President Obasanjo has been vocal in tackling corruption and reportedly warned officials their greed is undermining his attempts to win international debt relief. In March, he fired Education Minister Fabian Osuji in a broadcast to the nation during which he said 14 people had been involved in fraud and accused Mr. Osuji of offering a bribe of 55 million naira (US$417,000) to senate president Adolfus Wabara in order to get a bigger budget for his ministry."
"Dr. Stephen Schoenthaler, a Professor of Criminal Justice at the California State University in Stanislaus, has long argued that there is a","direct relationship between crime and poverty.
The poor are more likely to be victims of crime than those who have money. They also commit crimes because they lack the means to do otherwise. The poor are often forced into criminal activities by their circumstances.
Schoenthaler’s research shows that people living in poverty are less likely to get jobs or education. This leads them to live in areas with high levels of crime.
Poverty can lead to other problems such as drug addiction, which can make it harder for people to find work. It can also cause mental health issues, which can affect behavior","link between a healthy diet and decreased aggressive behaviour, as well as with increased IQ and school performance.

Dr. Schoenthaler is well-known for a youth detention center study where violations of house rules fell by 37% when vending machines were removed and the cafeteria replaced canned food by fresh alternatives. He summarizes his findings by saying that “Having a bad diet right now is a better predictor of future violence than past violent behaviour.” In a very large test, Schoenthaler directed a study in meals at 803 New York City schools, in low-income neighbourhoods, finding that the number of students passing final exams increased by 16%.

Critics have questioned some of Dr. Schoenthaler findings, due to the lack of placebo control groups. However, more recent work by Dr. Bernard Gesch, a physiologist at the University of Oxford, has placed some of the work on a more scientific footing. Dr. Gesch found that nutrition supplements produced a 26% drop in violations of prison rules over a placebo, and a 37% decrease in violent offences. The Netherlands has embarked on a wider scale dietary research program in 14 prisons.

The short term behaviour consequences of ingesting sugar are well understood: an initial burst on energy, followed a sugar low in which your body produces adrenalin, which makes you irritable and explosive. However, Schoenthaler and Gesch suggest that there are long term impacts over and above the short term consequences of blood sugar variations."
"England squared the Ashes series against Australia by holding on for a 2 run victory at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Australia","won the toss and elected to bat first, but were bowled out for just 180 runs with only Shane Watson (45) making any significant contribution.

England's reply was also not without problems as they lost wickets regularly throughout their innings. However, Ian Bell (73), who had been dropped from the side after the previous match, played an excellent knock to help his team reach 182/9 before being dismissed by James Pattinson.

The Australian bowlers then took control of proceedings, taking regular wickets and reducing England to 1","came close to victory themselves, however Steven Harminson took the wicket of Michael Kasprovic to clinch victory on the fourth day of the game.

The match looked to be in Englands hands following sterling batting from Kevin Pietersen (71, 20) and Andrew Flintoff (68, 73) which left the Australians needing to score 282 to win the match. The tourists were soon in trouble ending the third day at 175-8 with over 100 runs still to score and only 2 wickets in hand.

However on the fourth morning the Australian tailenders scored steadily and despite the loss of Shane Warne for 42 the final wicket pair closed in on the target.

The Edgbaston crowd were reduced to biting their nails as the match came down to the wire; Australia needing just 3 runs to win and England needing just one wicket.

Harmison produced a lifting delivery from just short of a length which Kasprovic could only fend off with a glove through to the England 'keeper Geraint Jones, leaving Australia agonisingly short of a memorable win and the series all square at one match each with three to play.

Scores: England 407 and 182, Australia 308 and 279"
"In Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin adopted the following resolution at their state convention:

:CALLING ON THE UN","ITED STATES SENATE TO VOTE NO ON THE BUSH-LEAHY AMENDMENT AND FOR A FULL AND OPEN IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION.

:Whereas, President Bush has failed to provide a plan for victory in Iraq; and

:Whereas, President Bush's proposed amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill would give him unlimited authority to wage war without Congressional oversight or debate; and

:Whereas, President Bush is asking Congress to vote on his proposal before he presents it","ITED STATES CONGRESS TO INITIATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST PRESIDENT BUSH, VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY AND DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS

:WHEREAS, the Downing Street Memo shows that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld began planning and executing the war on Iraq before seeking Congressional and UN approval;

:WHEREAS, UN weapons inspectors showed prior to the invasion that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; and

:WHEREAS, there is further mounting evidence that the Administration lied or misled about ""mushroom clouds,"" ""connections to 9/11,"" and ""war as a last resort"" as they sought UN, Congressional, and public approvals;

:THEREFORE, RESOLVED, the DPW asks Congress to immediately begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.

The resolution alleges that the Bush administration ""lied or misled"" Congress and the American people concerning the justification for the war. The ""Downing Street memo"" and reports from U.N. weapons inspectors are mentioned as evidence of deception.

Newly elected state party Chairman Joe Wineke said, ""Democrats, not only in Wisconsin but throughout the U.S., have been outraged by what we believe has been a clear cover-up of why the U.S. went into Iraq,"" and that the resolution expresses ""the sense of frustration that Democrats in Wisconsin have over fighting a war for the wrong reasons.""

Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor, does not think the resolution will be successful and said that even if the House of Representatives began impeachment proceedings against the president and vice president, ""I don't think you can impeach the secretary of defense""."
"Rebels from the Hutu-extremist ""Forces Nationales de Liberation"" have shot dead six churchgoers in Muhuta",", a village near Kigali.
The rebels are said to be led by former Rwandan army officers who were dismissed after the 1994 genocide against Tutsis.
They accuse President Paul Kagame of being behind the killing of their leader, Maj Gen Faustin Nyamwasa, who fled into exile in South Africa last year.
Mr Kagame's government has denied any involvement in Mr Nyamwasa's disappearance.
Rwanda is currently holding talks with Uganda over allegations that its troops crossed the border","district, Bujumbura-Rural, according to army spokesman Adolphe Manirakiza.

""The first criminal attack was committed in one church at Muhuta district where a group of FNL fighters fired in the church and killed six people including a pastor. They also injured seven others"", Manirakiza said.

He said the rebels shot dead a local government official and his brother and also kidnapped a policeman in the same district.

""We don't know yet why these people were killed, they may be executed because they refused to adhere to the FNL ideology, as the area where they have been killed is an FNL stronghold.""

Some 300,000 people have been killed since the fighting began in 1993.

Fresh talks between the government and the FNL have raised hopes among diplomats that Burundi can finally lift one of its last big barriers to peace.

Its leader Agathon Rwasa and Burundi President, Domitien Ndayizeye signed on May 15 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a cessation of hostilities deal seen as a significant step toward finally bringing the rebels into the peace process.

But the rebels and the army have clashed sporadically since the truce."
The Mozilla Foundation released the second major security update this week for their flagship browser Firefox. The fix patches a serious flaw in the way Firefox,"handles PDF files, which could allow attackers to remotely take control of vulnerable machines.
The new version 3.5.2 is available for download from the official website and addresses two critical flaws that were discovered by researcher Jann Horn at Google. One of them was already fixed in an earlier release but it was not included in the final build.
""This issue affects Firefox 3.0.x only,"" said the advisory published on Tuesday. ""It does not affect Firefox 3.5 or later.""
Firefox users are advised to install the latest version as soon","handles animated GIF image files. Firefox browsers infected by malicious code could experience a buffer overflow, temporarily locking up or ""freezing"" a user's computer, or even executing arbitrary code which could take over a user's computer.

The flaw was discovered and reported by Internet Security Systems, Inc. The upgrade was the second major security fix in less than a month for the browser, which has grown in popularity to ten percent of the browser market in the United States.

Although there were no known exploits of the bug, Chris Hoffman, director of engineering at Mozilla, told reporters, ""because Mozilla is committed to delivering the most secure product possible, we decided to quickly issue an update to patch the bug.""

The Mozilla Foundation did not offer any details about the issue of vulnerability, but a second major security overhaul in such a short time underscores challenges faced by the nonprofit foundation as it goes head-to-head with the market leading Internet Explorer browser by Microsoft.

The new release, Firefox version 1.0.2, ""illustrates the dedication of the strong community of developers working on the product,"" according to Hoffman. ""...we’re able to turn around patches much faster than a traditional corporation,"" he added.

Users can download the update at no charge, and can find additional information at the Mozilla website."
Despite assurances from the European Commissioner for the Internal Market Charles McCreevy that the Council would adopt its controversial Common Position text covering Software,"Patents on 20th June, it has now been postponed until July.
The delay is due to a number of member states still being unable to agree on the wording of the document. The UK and Germany are reportedly pushing for an amendment which would allow patent applications to be filed in Europe before they have been examined by national patent offices. This would mean that software patents could be granted without any prior scrutiny as to whether or not they were valid.
""We're very pleased with this decision,"" said Dr Richard Taylor, Director of the Foundation for Information Policy","Patents, members voted to restart the entire process with a new directive.

MEP Michel Rocard noted several ""inelegancies"" by the Commission in his speech against the directive, such as not taking into account any of the Parliament's substantive amendments in its recommendation to the Council. He also took the Dutch and German governments to task for ignoring their respective parliaments. The Irish Presidency's sponsorship by Microsoft was also criticised, as were the attempted ratifications at fishery Council meetings.

There was also confusion over the actual effects of the proposed directive with industry players confirming that the Council text allowed pure software patents, while the Commission claimed it would not.

""In the debate, broad agreement prevailed over the fact that the current proposal was counter-productive and far from a good basis for a decision,"" said Italian MEP Monica Frassoni.

The computer-implemented inventions directive was voted down by members of European Parliament (MEP) in the legal affairs committee. 19 MEPs voted in favour of re-starting negotiations, 2 against with one abstention."
"Bobby Abreu, welcome to the spotlight.

The Philadelphia Phillies star, now 31 and a two-time All-Star",", is finally getting his due as one of baseball's best players.

""I think he's going to be in the Hall of Fame,"" said teammate Pat Burrell. ""He's that good.""

Abreu has been so good for so long that it's easy to forget how much better he could have been if not for injuries. He missed all but three games in 2004 because of a broken wrist. In 2005, he played only 89 games after breaking his ankle.

But this season, healthy and happy",", has produced well for the Phillies over the last half a decade without the glamour of other top players. However, last night there was no denying that he was the star of the show.

And what a show it was. The first batter in the 2005 Home Run Derby, Abreu proceeded to shatter the previous record of 15 home runs in a round, belting 24, including a 517-foot moonshot that exited the stadium in right field, going through two bats in the process. This rampage came immediately after ESPN announcers Chris Berman and Joe Morgan described Comerica Park, the site of the Derby, as a difficult park to hit home runs in.

In the second round, Abreu edged past Boston's David Ortiz (who himself hit an astounding 17 homeruns in the first round) and Milwaukee's Carlos Lee to earn a spot in the finals alongside Detroit star Ivan Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who snuck into the second round with 7 dingers, swatted the most in the second round, but his home-field advantage deserted him in the finals as Abreu smashed 11 over the fences to win the Derby for his native Venezuela.

Abreu's three-round total of 41 homers broke Miguel Tejada's record of 27, set last year in Houston's Minute Maid Park."

"Blogshine Sunday, a national effort among webloggers to publicize the importance of open access to government information is scheduled to take place on March","25.
The event was inspired by an earlier blogging campaign called Open Access Day that took place in January. The organizers of both events are hoping to raise awareness about the need for greater transparency and accountability from our elected officials.
""Blogshine Sunday will be a day when we all stand up and say 'enough' to secrecy,"" said one organizer, who goes by the pseudonym ""blogger."" ""We want to make it clear that we expect our leaders to tell us what they know, not just what they think we should know.""
The organizers have","13, 2005.

On that day, FreeCulture.org will organize web-based writers to relate their experiences and thoughts on open-access to governmental records and freely available public information. Webloggers will be encouraged to highlight the need to have public records available in electronic formats to facilitate easier searching of information and more widespread access. Another goal of Blogshine Sunday is to emphasize that open access to governmental information should be granted to everyone, unpaid reporters and bloggers as well as professional journalists.

Recently, bloggers have played an important role in shaping public opinion about issues that were initially overlooked by traditional media. Freerepublic.com blogger Harry W. MacDougald was the first to scrutinize documents that suggested that President Bush was derelict in his military service in the 1970s. CBS News reported on the documents as if they were legitimate, but MacDougald discovered that the documents used a typestyle that was not available at the time they were supposedly written. Following MacDougald’s blog posts questioning the documents, CBS said that they regretted reporting on the documents as though they were authentic. Since bloggers are generally unpaid and do not have the editorial restrictions of professional journalists, as the MacDougald example illustrates, they are sometimes better able to research and report on issues not covered by traditional media.

Blogshine Sunday is held in conjunction with Sunshine Sunday, when professional journalists and news media will publish articles and editorials on the importance of the open records. Freeculture.org was started last April by two college students in an effort to show that technology can better facilitate public affairs involvement. More information on Blogshine Sunday can be found at: BlogShine.org"
Schapelle Corby was today found guilty by an Indonesian court for the importation of 4 kilograms of marijuana to Bali,".
The verdict comes after a trial that lasted more than two years and has been closely watched around the world.
Corby, who is from Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, was arrested at Denpasar airport on October 8, 2004, as she arrived back from her honeymoon in Bali with her new husband, Mervyn Peris.
She had spent nine months in jail before being released on bail while awaiting trial. She was then placed under house arrest until the verdict was announced.
The prosecution argued that Corby had packed",". She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The verdict was handed down by three judges amidst tight security at the Denpasar District Court.

The verdict was read in Indonesian and relayed to Corby via her translator. The court erupted as the outcome became clear. Her family and supporters screamed at the judge, and said that justice had not been done. ""Scheppelle is innocent!"" one supporter said.

Her lawyer reported before the verdict was handed down that she was terrified. ""She's probably the worst I've ever seen her,"" he said.

After the verdict she stopped briefly to hug her family before being loaded into a van and driven away.

Corby was arrested at Denpasar Airport last October. On her trip to Bali, she flew from Brisbane to Sydney and then changed planes. Her defense centered around the claim that Australian airport baggage handlers placed the drugs in her bodyboard bag as part of a drug smuggling ring. It was claimed that the drugs were being smuggled from Brisbane to Sydney, but for some reason were not removed before her luggage was transferred to the Indonesian flight.

After a lengthy trial that attracted much media attention in Australia, prosecutors called for the judges to hand down a life sentence.

Hundreds of supporters and friends gathered at Tugun Surf-Lifesaving Club on the Gold Coast to watch the verdict and show their support.

Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that he felt for Corby but that Australians had to trust the Indonesian justice system. ""We have to respect the justice system of other countries,"" he said.

The judge said she had until next Wednesday to appeal."

The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is deploying its new Homeland Security Information Network - Secret (HSIN-Secret) in,"the coming weeks.
The HSIN-Secret will be used to share classified information with DHS components and other federal, state, local, tribal, and private sector partners. It will replace the current Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), which has been used for classified communications since 2001.
""This network will provide a secure environment for our personnel to communicate and collaborate on critical homeland security issues,"" said DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson. ""It will also enhance interoperability between DHS and our partners.""
The HSIN-Secret","all 50 state Emergency Operations Centers as well as 18 additional state and local law enforcement sites. ""The secret network is a component of the HSIN, which is the primary conduit for DHS to share information on terrorist threats, suspicious activity and incident management with state, local, tribal and private-sector officials."" reports Government Computer News.

Development on this $350 million system by Northrop Grumman Corporation was begun in March of 2004 with basic operation achieved in just 4 months.

""The Homeland is more secure when each hometown is more secure,"" said Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge in DHS's February 24, 2004 press release that launched the program. ""Future program expansion will include the county level, communication at the classified SECRET level, and the involvement of the private sector."" it continues.

With the ""Secret"" component in place, classified information can now be disseminated to authorized individuals at all levels of government and business throughout the country almost instantly. HSIN lets most government agencies as well as many private companies doing business with the government share information on the whereabouts and suspicious activities of anyone that comes to their attention. Internal policies and the judgement of the system's users provide privacy and civil rights protections, while who can access the system is determined by DHS."
