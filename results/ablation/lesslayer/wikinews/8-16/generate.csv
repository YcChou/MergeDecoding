"On Monday, the Israeli army withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Palestinians rejoiced over this occasion, with Mahmoud Abb","as saying he is committed to a two state solution. He has promised that no terrorist will return to the West Bank.
The world was relieved by the end of hostilities and the United Nations called on all parties to resume negotiations for a long term ceasefire. The European Union announced it would hold an international peace summit on 10 December to bring about a final agreement.

The 38 years of Israeli presence in the Gaza strip have officially ended.

Palestinians were overjoyed at the sight of the burning synagogues, planting flags in the midst of it all, and shouting cries of independence. Teenagers set fire to a few synagogues, letting out anger at Israel's occupation.

The fires did little damage to the concrete structures, but Abbas said that the Palestinians planned to destroy them fully.

Palestinian police admitted that there was not much they could or would do to stop this.

Last year, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy the synagogues, but this Sunday, under pressure from religious Jewish organizations, it reversed its decision. Palestinians were angry at the cabinet's Sunday vote.

The synagogues, as well as all community structures, including community centers, schools, and sports facilites, are the only physical remnants of the Israeli Gaza Strip presence since all residential structures have been destroyed."
"Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, today announced that the 2004/2005 season of the National Hockey League","has been cancelled. He was aided and abetted in his decision by a small group of people that are not from Canada.
The reason for the cancellation is a dispute over player contracts that will expire at the end of the current season. The players have stated their case to be paid what the other professional sports players make.
I would like to point out to those involved that professional sports is an entirely different world than other businesses. When one makes a contract with a player to play a game for them for a number of years, there is a great amount of risk on both sides.
In a","has been canceled. The announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days. The dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players. The majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount. The club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million. Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said ""The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.""

This will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded. That year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off."

Nation of Islam and Arab nation: Rejoice for it is time to take revenge against the British Zionist Crusader government in retaliation for the massacres Britain is committing in Iraq and Afghanistan. The heroic mujahideen have carried out a blessed raid in London. Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters.

We have repeatedly warned the British Government and people. We have fulfilled our promise and carried out our blessed military raid in Britain after our mujahideen exerted strenuous efforts over a long period of time to ensure the success of the raid.

We continue to warn the governments of Denmark and Italy and all the Crusader governments that they will be punished in the same way if they do not withdraw their troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. He who warns is excused.

Molson Canada picks up Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. as the company maneuvers to make an entry into the craft beer,"market.
The $105 million purchase is a key component in the $8.4-billion, 30-year alliance that was announced on Friday by Sleeman Breweries of Guelph and InBev of Belgium. The two brewing companies will join to become one of North America’s largest beer producers with sales in excess of $6.2 billion.
Under the new structure, Creemore will operate as a stand-alone business.
In a statement issued Monday, Creemore president John Allen said he is confident his 100 employees","market.

Creemore Springs of Creemore, Ontario, produces the locally popular Creemore Springs lager. The merger will allow the company to retain its identity.

""The Creemore brand image and brewing craft will remain unchanged,"" Creemore Springs Brewery chairman Bill Wilder said. ""Molson understands and appreciates what is special about the Creemore brand and this makes them a great purchaser for the company.""

Industry observers are mixed on the benefits of the deal for Molson. The CBC reports one analyst suggests Molson may be trying to replicate the success of rival Labatt's premium beers. Others point out the small brewery model does not scale up well, and the attraction of a ""boutique"" beer fades in large-scale production.

The World Health Organisation has announced that the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatments (ART) in developing countries is increasing significantly - more,"than 100,000 a month.
The United Nations health agency has been supporting treatment for AIDS since 2000 through a programme that provides funding to poorer countries and which is being extended for a further two years.
In a statement on Friday, the WHO said it was committed to reaching an estimated 5 million people by 2005 with HIV/AIDS treatment.
It said: ""Treatment has increased from about 800 a month in 2000 to over 10,000 a month","than doubling between December 2003 and June 2005. One million people are now getting the drugs they need, compared to just 400,000 eighteen months ago.

However, access to treatment is not growing as fast as demand, and the UN is unlikely to reach its target of treating three million people by the end of 2005 - just over half the people who need it. The longer-term target of universal treatment by 2010 is still likely to be met.

The figures show that the number of people receiving ART is increasing in every part of the globe, but not as quickly as people are contracting HIV. The numbers getting treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, the part of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS has increased threefold on a year ago, and doubled in the last six months. The same rate of growth as also been seen in Asia, the second-worst affected area.

The WHO's report highlights that the best progress has been made when governments have worked together with the WHO, the UN and other parterners. The report goes on to make recommendations for simplifying the process to enable treatment levels to be increased even faster.

The UN's target was based on what was hypothetically possible if all possible steps to provide treatment were taken. The report shows the while financial, political and technical steps have been made, other areas are falling short.

Pressure groups said that countries were reacting too slowly to the pandemic and called on the G8 to provide more sustainable funding for universal treatment for Aids.

UK international development minister Gareth Thompson said: ""We are committed to universal access to HIV treatments by 2010. We will spend £1.5bn in the next three years on Aids, including £150m on orphans."""
A recent survey conducted by the American Cancer Society has turned up some surprising results: Americans generally hold false beliefs about the nature of cancer and its treatment,".
The survey was conducted to learn what people believe about cancer, how that impacts their lifestyles, and whether those beliefs are in fact true or not. The researchers found that many people have a number of misconceptions about cancer.
In particular, 80% of those surveyed thought that smoking causes most cancers. The researchers point out, however, that tobacco is responsible for less than 1/5th of all cancers.
Other misconceptions were that obesity was a risk factor for all cancers (it is linked with a small number",", even though many believe they are well informed.

Health experts say this ignorance could be dangerous: People may be making poor health decisions -- avoiding cancer screenings or rejecting potentially life-saving treatments -- based on their incorrect notions.

The most common misconception is that surgery causes cancer to spread. Decades ago, cancer often was not discovered until it was very advanced. At that stage, surgical efforts were rarely successful, and many patients died soon after procedures were performed. This may have given rise to the mistaken belief that the surgeries caused the disease to worsen.

Another commonly held myth is that there is a cure for cancer, but the medical industry is withholding it in order to continue profiting from the sale of less effective treatments and medications.

Believers in this ""conspiracy theory"" may not be guided by it in making their personal health decisions, though. The American Cancer Society says that even though many people are suspicious of the medical industry in general, they have a trusting relationship with their own physicians and are likely to follow their advice.

Almost 20 percent of the people surveyed felt that medications for cancer pain were ineffective.

About 10 percent expressed the belief that cancer could be cured with a positive attitude alone, while a similar number felt that there was no effective treatment for cancer.

The fact is, cancer survival and treatments -- including pain management -- have vastly improved in the last thirty years.

Results of the survey appear in the August 1 issue of Cancer, a journal published by the American Cancer Society."

Brazil is threatening to break the patent of US-based Abbott Laboratories as it pushes ahead with its programme to supply its people with,"free insulin.
The drug has long been available at a much lower price in India than elsewhere and Brazil hopes that will change after a court there ruled on Friday that a government plan to issue 10 million doses was legal.
Abbott said on Sunday that Brazil was trying to use a public health law to bypass international trade rules, a stance Brazil’s foreign minister called a “threat of aggression” against the company.
Insulin is used to treat diabetes. The condition is widespread in Brazil, where about 6 million of the 54","free AIDS drugs.

Brazil has given Abbott a deadline of July 7 to cut the prices of its drug Kaletra or a Brazilian company will begin cloning it. This move would test recent World Trade Organization concessions allowing poor countries to produce generic drugs for local health emergencies.

Abbott has said that Brazil's demand goes ""against the spirit"" of the WTO agreement, since it has the ninth largest economy in the world, and that this could damage future research for improved treatments.

Previous programmes have been negotiated between companies and governments to produce generic versions of AIDS drugs, but this is the first time a country has threatened to use powers negotiated at the WTO by producing the drug without the cooperation of the patent holder.

Several campaign groups are supporting the move, hoping that other developing countries will be able to take the lead of Brazil and produce generic drugs for their own populations. Michael Bailey, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam International, said: ""The impact of breaking the patent would be enormous. If a major country such as Brazil goes through with this, not only will it help ensure sustainability of their excellent treatment programme, it will set a hugely important precedent for other countries.""

The US Chamber of Commerce has issued a statement urging Brazil to reconsider and suggesting that the move could create a rift between the countries. Thomas Donohue, Chamber President and CEO said: ""Brazil’s threat to strip patent rights from a U.S. company should concern all investors and every business around the world because of the precedent it sets for the treatment of intellectual property."""
Millions of origami cranes have been dropped on Thailand's three southern provinces following violence between the government and ethnic minority Muslim populations,"there.
The cranes are a symbol of peace in Japanese folklore. The number is thought to bring good fortune or long life.
A total of 10 million origami cranes will be dropped from planes by Japan over a two-day period.
The planes are taking off from Osaka on Sunday, with one going over Pattani on Monday.
A further five million will be dropped by parachute at an open day for children on Sunday.
""We would like to use origami as a way to show that people all around the world care about what has been going",". The move has been called a ""goodwill gesture"" towards Muslims.

Up to 120 million such paper sculptures were dropped on Thailand's three southern-most provinces, Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. Tensions in this area have increased recently, peaking with the recent death of 85 demonstrators arrested during a protest. The government blamed their deaths on physical weakness due to fasting in the month of Ramadan as the cause, as most if not all the deaths occurred during transport of up to 500 arrested protestors. Critics of the Thai government have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, blaming the ""over-eagerness"" of Thai security forces as the cause of the deaths.

The dispersal was timed to coincide with the birthday of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and has generated much interest from the rest of the country's predominantly Buddhist population.
The cranes were built by citizens throughout Thailand and had peace messages written on them. The southern, Muslim provinces are often considered neglected by a north that is larger and of the majority ethnic group. Some have welcomed the goodwill gesture, but critics in both the north and south have said that the resources would have been better spent solving the problems in the south. Some Islamic leaders in the south have also expressed concerns that the gesture may not be properly understood by Muslims, as the crane carries no cultural significance with them."
"In the wake of a United States Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. New London on eminent domain last week, a California man has proposed","that his community should use the government’s power to take people’s land for public use and give the land to him.
The case involved Connecticut town that used its eminent domain authority to acquire 150 acres of land from two small businessmen to transfer ownership to a private development corporation. The court held that a taking is not per se unconstitutional. Instead, a court will evaluate whether a public use was a ""rational"" one.
A number of groups are filing lawsuits around the nation against state and local governments over their use of eminent domain. A federal judge","that Justice David Souter's New Hampshire home be seized by the state and a hotel be built on the site. Logan Darrow Clements faxed a letter to town officials in Weare, New Hampshire June 28, 2005 that justified the action as such:

""The justification for such an eminent domain action is that our hotel will better serve the public interest as it will bring in economic development and higher tax revenue to Weare.""

Justice Souter, who was in the majority ruling in the Kelo case, has lived at the farmhouse in Weare since he was 11 years old. Clements indicated that it was necessary to build on that location because ""it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans."" The action has given rise to a great deal of support nationwide, as many are writing to the councilors of the small town of Weare to voice their approval for the proposal.

The proposal for the ""Lost Liberty Hotel"", as it is to be called, features a number of components which seem to focus on the libertarian leanings of its designer. A dining room, called the ""Just Desserts Cafe"" and a museum based on the ""loss of freedom in America"" are two such components. Instead of a Bible provided by the Gideons (a standard item placed in most American hotel rooms), each guest will receive a free copy of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged."
People all over the Netherlands are voting today in a referendum on the EU constitution. This the first national referendum for two hundred years and it is non,"-binding, which is not that reassuring.
The polls show a 51% no to 49% yes with a high margin of error. But what will the vote mean? The government has promised a new vote on a revised treaty. And what would a no vote mean in practice? The UK rejected a European Constitution by a larger majority. A year on we have an even closer association with Europe than we did before. The French rejected a European Constitution. France is now at the heart of a Europe in turmoil.
A no vote could well mean a delay. But how long a","-binding. Though most major political parties have stated they will abide by the referendum if the outcome is sufficiently clear and a large enough percentage of the voters have actually voted.
The question put to voters will be:

:Bent U voor of tegen instemming door Nederland met het verdrag tot vaststelling van een grondwet voor Europa?
:""Are you for or against approval by the Netherlands of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe?""

All the main political parties have asked for a voor (for, or yes) vote. However polls have been saying that two-thirds of the people will be voting tegen (against, or no).

One reason for people to vote no is the expansion of the European Union with large countries like Turkey, which they fear will cause less influence for the smaller countries. The view of an European super state in which the Netherlands would loose its own identity is another reason for voting no. Some of the no voters do this to show they don't agree with the current political situation and the supposed risen prices since the introduction of the euro.

As of 14:00 CET, 9% more voters had turned up for the referendum than for the European elections.

"At UN World Headquarters in New York on Friday, February 4, 2005, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations",", Dr. Samir Shakir Mahmoud Sumaidaie, was a special guest of honor at a high-profile press conference by a prominent and well-informed American writer who is an outspoken critic of the Bush administration.
The writer is Gore Vidal. He has written many books on politics, history and other subjects. The occasion for his press conference was to publicize a new book that he has published: Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace.
Iraq is not a small player on the world scene. But its government is weak.
In a situation such as the",", Samir Sumaidaie, declared to reporters that the international body of the United Nations helped the regime of Saddam Hussein. This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's Oil-for-Food program with Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali although there is no charge against him in the report.

In an interview with Voice of America reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie said: ""In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later.... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program.""

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.

After being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said: ""Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him.""

On Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: ""We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it."""
"Bitmover, the company producing a management program for computer source code named Bitkeeper (BK), announced on April 5 that it will no longer","continue development of BK. Instead, Bitmover is shifting to developing products and services in the mobile space.
The decision was made at a shareholders’ meeting on April 1. The company plans to wind up by the end of May.
In an open letter posted to its web site on April 6, CEO John Palfrey explained, “We are committed to giving our customers time to evaluate other tools that can help them with their open source development work. We have provided some resources to help people learn about those tools on the Bitkeeper website.
Palfrey continued, “I would like","be providing a free version of its product.

As a result of Bitmover's announcement, the programmer who wrote the original Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds, stated on a mailing list that he ""decided to not use BK mainly because he needs to figure out the alternatives"". As to an alternative to Bitkeeper, Torvalds hinted that he is considering Monotone but that Subversion, a recent replacement for CVS, is out of the running. Bitkeeper was originally developed to allow Torvalds to manage code contributions more easily, according to Jeremy Andrews at Kerneltrap.org, and was previously provided to kernel developers free of charge, though it was restricted in its use.

Bitkeeper is the software that Torvalds and hundreds of other Linux developers use to manage submissions of code to the Linux kernel, the heart of the computer operating systems referred to as ""Linux"" or ""GNU/Linux"". Linux is distributed in many different forms, bundled with other software by companies such as Red Hat, Novell, and Linspire.

While the details are not clear, it appears from Andrews' article that Bitmover's decision to stop releasing the free version of Bitkeeper is related to a dispute with Torvalds' employer, Open Source Development Labs (OSDL).

According to Kerneltrap, an OSDL contractor had been reverse engineering the free version of Bitkeeper in order to make an open source replacement, which is prohibited by the license under which the free version of Bitkeeper is released. Nevertheless, Torvalds notes in his post that he is ""personally very happy with BK, and with Larry McVoy, the CEO of Bitmover."""

""This funding is available to help","to approximately 600 former RAAF maintenance workers, who where exposed to highly toxic chemicals while working on the fuel tanks of the nation's F-111 fleet.

Under the government's proposal, depending on the amount of exposure, a worker can expect to receive between A$10,000 and A$40,000 (US $7,500 - $30,000) to help cope with the side effects. The aircraft maintenance program started in the 1970s and was suspended in the late 1990s when the former workers started to show signs of medical problems ranging from memory loss to neurological problems.

The F-111 Deseal/Reseal Support Group responded to the government's package with anger. The Group's president Ian Fraser said ""A$40,000 for a ruined life is simply not enough ... We've already got people who have died, who are dying, people who have lost their homes.""

The third Test ended in a draw (with England one wicket away from a win), and England narrowly won the fourth Test in Nottingham by three wickets after the English enforced follow on after a poor first innings by Australia.

The fifth and final Test started on 8 September at the Oval in London. It entered its final day evenly balanced with all results still possible and the destination of the urn still in doubt. Australia needed to win to force a 2-2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give them to England, ending 18 years and eight series of Australian dominance. In the end, England managed to bat out the final day, and a draw ensured the Ashes were coming back to England.

Kevin Pietersen and Ashley Giles hit personal bests of 158 and 59 respectively, to bat out the best part of the last day. Pieterson's 158 was his maiden test century, and included 7 sixes. Early in the day, Australia looked to be in with a chance of winning the match, with early wickets leaving England at 67 for 3. Giles and Pietersen's century partnership, though, left Australia with no hope of catching England in the remains of the day, sealing England's Ashes win since 1987.

England's next Tests will be an away series in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the world champions Australia will play an ICC World XI (which inclues Kevin Pietersen, Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff) in the Johnnie Walker Super Series in early October."
Space.com reported yesterday on a picture of a planet taken by the Very Large Telescope located in Chile. The European Southern Observatory's,"VLT is an interferometer consisting of 8 telescopes that can work together to act as one much larger telescope.
The article has some pretty cool images, and talks about some of the discoveries being made with it. But what caught my eye was a statement at the end:
""This new image will help astronomers better understand how planets are formed,"" said Gudrun Pfeifer of ESO.
Astrologers have been saying for thousands of years that planets influence people. Of course, we all know that astrology is not a science. We can all","telescope, which was used to capture the picture, has made the first confirmed discovery of a planet orbiting another star.

Scientists have been trying to locate planets outside our own solar system for nearly 10 years. Inferences of nearly 150 planets in other solar systems have been observed so far by using instruments and measurements that only suggest the existence of another planet. Until now, no planet has been confirmed by the means of a photographed image. There was, months earlier, another team of scientists who took pictures of what might be another planet, but that image remains controversial because it shows what may be an even more distant object instead.

The research team that photographed the planet with its host star was led by Ralph Neuhaeuser of the Astrophysical Institute &amp; University Observatory (AIU). ""The detection of the faint object near the bright star is certain,"" he told Space.com on Friday.

The new image contains the star, GQ Lupi, with an orbiting planet. It is smaller than our sun, 70% the size, and is located 400 light-years away from our solar system. The planet is nearly twice the size of Jupiter. Unlike our sun which is 4.6 billion years old, the GQ Lupi star is approximately 1 million years old and is considered very young for a star. The planet orbiting GQ Lupi is three times further out than Neptune's orbit around our sun, and scientists estimate the orbiting period to be about 1,200 years. The planets wide orbiting distance from the GQ Lupi was an important element for enabling the photograph to be taken.

The planet, much like the star it orbits, is very hot &amp;mdash; about 2,000 degrees Kelvin &amp;mdash; so despite the detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, which at that temperature would make it gaseous, there is no expectation it might support life.

The discovery will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics."
"Young Quakers who planned to take part in the World Gathering of Young Friends at Lancaster University, England have been unable to attend after having","their passports withheld by the Israeli authorities.
The five young people are members of a Palestinian organisation that was not on a list of groups recognised by the Israeli government for entry into the country. The five are aged 18 and 19.
A statement from Quakers in Britain said: ""We are shocked by the actions of the Israeli authorities which appear to be punishing them for the work that they do to raise the plight of the people of the West Bank. We believe this is unacceptable.
""It is particularly disturbing to us as we were about","their visas denied.

Their absence has been a cause of ""hurt"" at the meetings. Sara Wolcott of Pacific Yearly Meeting on the Western coast of America wrote in a journal on the WGYF website: ""I saw in a workshop for Friends planning to meet in Kenya how much the absence of so many Friends was felt; the gathering felt incomplete. We desperately wanted our brothers and sisters to be with us, I know they wanted to be here too.""

Most of the denials were for economic reasons, if someone doesn't have a high enough income or a fixed job it can be assumed that they will stay in the country for work. Representatives from the gathering now plan to go to Kenya in October to share some of the programme with those who were unable to come.

Despite the missing Friends, the gathering has brought together a mix of different Quaker traditions in a positive atmosphere that has been appreciated by participants. Many Quakers worship in silence (unprogrammed meetings) while others, particularly in America and Africa, have ministers like other churches. Quakers also have differences of opinion over theological issues, including even the existence of God, but the young Friends have not found this to be an obstacle to coming together. Unlike many traditional Christian sects, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, encourage each member to explore his or her own relationship with God.

Chrissy Muhr of Northwest Yearly Meeting (Northwest US) wrote: ""I've been really impressed by how the mix of worship styles has been handled. Almost all the programmed Friends I've spoken to have some prior experience of unprogrammed worship. For me, the hardest thing has been not falling asleep during long periods of silence - the long week has begun to take its toll."""
A new redesigned US $10 bill was introduced at a ceremony yesterday on Ellis Island. The new bill adds three new background colors; red,", white and blue to the current design of a black and white image.
The redesign is being called a security enhancement by the United States government, which hopes that it will help stop the production of fake money.
The redesign has caused much controversy among people with disabilities who use Braille for reading. Many are complaining about the loss of raised dots from the $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000,",", yellow and orange. It continues to feature Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. The $10 bill is the third US bill to switch from the traditional green. The $20 and $50 bills were redesigned to feature color within the past two years.

The improvements in digital technology have made it much easier for counterfeiters. ""Ten years ago, 1 percent of (counterfeit) bills were produced on digital equipment. These days, 56 percent are produced on digital equipment, and the technology is more accessible to the general population,"" said Eric Zahren, spokesman for the Secret Service.

According to the Treasury Department, to be able to keep ahead of counterfeiters currency will need to continue to be updated every seven to ten years. The $10 bill was last redesigned in 2000. ""The intention was not to create a counterfeit-proof note&amp;mdash;which is basically impossible&amp;mdash;but one that's harder to duplicate and easier to authenticate,"" said Zahren. This new bill includes many new and enhanced security features such as color-shifting ink, a watermark, microprinting and a security thread

Dawn Haley of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said in a statement ""The new $10 note design continues the U.S. Government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure."" The new $10 bill is expected to go into circulation in early 2006."

Thousands of Ohio citizens have reported experiencing problems casting their votes due to long lines at polling places, malfunctioning voting machines, inexplicable numbers of votes cast, and disenfranchisement in urban areas.

""The integrity of our democracy is at stake. We need to give the American people confidence that each and every vote will be properly counted and that the democratic electoral process is respected,"" Wu said. ""I also understand concerns about the conflict of interest of having an official in charge of running elections in a key state also heading a presidential campaign. I agree that Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell's dual role calls into question any election decision he made that favored Republicans.""

Other Congressmen including John Conyers (D-MI), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and Robert Wexler (D-FL) voiced similar concerns, and requested an investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), citing specific cases in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, and California.

In December, Conyers, the Ranking Democrat on the House Committee on the Judiciary, issued a series of letters about voting irregularities to the media, campaign officials, and manufacturers of voting equipment. These letters seek to collect and preserve information regarding the conduct of the election.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office previously reported on voting irregularities in eariler presidential elections.

"Missing American teen Natalee Holloway, who vanished on the Dutch island of Aruba two weeks ago, is feared to be","dead after a man was found with a woman’s body in a car.

The soldier was shot when he tried to disarm an insurgent who was attacking a convoy. The man was not armed with a pistol or grenades. He was carrying a rocket launcher that exploded as a result of a security alert.

The agreement is part of an ongoing process to bring about a cessation of hostilities, as well as a series of other political, security, humanitarian, economic, social, and development measures. The parties are committed to reaching a final agreement by 10 May.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called for all parties to show their full support to this initiative. He reiterates that there will be no military solution to the crisis and calls on all parties to resume a negotiations process without further delay.
In a statement to the press","Kenyan capital Nairobi, under the watchful eye of United Nations ambassadors.

According to the BBC, the document concluded with a memorandum saying that ""prompt completion of the peace process is essential for all the people of Sudan"". The actual peace treaty should, according to the pledge, be signed no later than December 31st 2004. While the pledge focuses mainly on the fights between the rebels in the south and the Khartoum-based government in the north, there is also attention for the ongoing crisis in east Sudan (Darfur).

Several aid agencies have criticized the UN for taking a weak stand against the Sudanese government. The Security Council has already signed two resolutions threatening economic sanctions against Sudan if the government does not disarm its troops in Darfur, but, so the BBC reports, the violence is continuing. The civil war in Darfur was sparked in 2003, when insurgents started attacking government buildings. The Arab government in Khartoum subsequently sent troops to the region, which have been reported to mass-violate human rights of the black Africans living in Darfur."
"In anticipation of a Security Council vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the International Criminal Court, Sudan announced today it would reject","the court.
The statement is not an official rejection of the court. The decision has to be taken by a presidential decree that will have to be published in a government newspaper and could come after a public debate.
In 1998, the United States rejected the court when President Clinton was president. But he changed course two years later.
Mr. Mbeki said South Africa was against a unilateral rejection of the court. He said such a decision should come through negotiations with the court.
African leaders are scheduled to hold talks on Darfur next month.","any United Nations resolution that required war crimes suspects to be tried abroad. The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the French delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week.

Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, ""Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese &amp;mdash; whether he is a rebel or government official &amp;mdash; outside the Sudan: we are totally against it."" In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group ""Justice and Equality of Movement,"" said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace.

Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to human rights abuses in Darfur. Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts.

The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias. It has often been suggested that this qualifies as genocide, and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights."

The officer continues, ""Couey admitted to molesting his wife's daughter, however, she agreed not to report the incident if he left the house and gave her a divorce, which he did."" CNN was unable to locate Couey's former wife.

The revelation calls into question the way Couey has been dealt with by officials over the years. He spoke on the 1991 tape about how he ""needs help"" and ""wants help"".

Mary Doyle, a Citrus County probation official, said Monday that if they had known Couey was a registered sex offender, they may have been able to keep him away from Jessica Lunsford. Florida Courts do not provide probation workers with criminal backgrounds of their probationers, even in the case of registered sexual offenders like Couey, Doyle said. With that information they might have tried harder to locate him when he failed to report in with probation officials last November. When detectives did finally catch up with him, they learned he had been living across the road from Jessica."

Whilst this was not immediately debated, Senator Bob Brown had asked the Acting Deputy President of the Senate to look into the matter. Later the President of the Senate ruled that the gesture was ""unseemly but not obscene"".

This ruling caused a fierce debate, with Senator Brown saying that McGauran's ""arrogant and disgusting"" actions exemplified the Government's attitude towards its new-found Senate majority, whilst Senator Ron Boswell, the National Party Senate leader, had criticised Brown of hypocrisy, stating that Brown had ""broken every law in Australia"" and ""every law in Tasmania"" (which Bartlett noted as a point of order as being hyperbole).

"Rabies is a disease that has no cure and nearly everyone it infects is dead just two weeks after the symptoms show. And yet,","rabies has not been eliminated from our world.
The virus can be contracted through an open wound, by being bitten or scratched by a rabid animal. But in 1885, Pasteur was the first to develop a rabies vaccine that could protect humans against the virus. The rabies virus is found in saliva of rabid animals. When a rabid animal is exposed to a non-rabid animal, the rabies virus will not infect the other animal.
Pasteur used a live attenuated rabies virus to","last week a teenage girl named Jeanna Giese was released from a hospital having been successfuly treated. She became the first known person to recover from the disease without vaccination.

On September 12, 2004, Jeanna &amp;mdash; a 15 year old from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin&amp;mdash; was bitten by a bat while attending church. By the time she saw a doctor about fatigue and numbness, it was October 18, and the bat incident was not brought up until several days later. Usually when there is a possibility of rabies, doctors will vaccinate patients: the vaccine has a chance to act before the symptoms appear. In Jeanna's case it was too late to try to vaccinate, and her doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin devised a new treatment. Jeanna was put into a drug-induced coma for a week, and doctors began an intensive treatment to prop up her nervous system until her natural immunity recovered enough to fight the disease.

By surviving and recovering, Jeanna became the only person known in medicine to overcome rabies without a vaccine. She is not yet fully recovered: the effects of the coma are still apparent, and she has difficulty with movement. Yet the doctors believe that she is getting well much faster than they expected, and feel that Jeanna will be able to return to her high school studies, needing only physical and occupational therapy.

The novel treatment is hailed by doctors as promising, but needs analysis and verification on another human. Jeanna's is the sixth case of human recovery from a rabies infection, but the other five people were vaccinated against rabies either before infection, or before the symptoms appeared."

He should","death of her only son, a father of three, who was about to return home to Australia and had been planning a career change. Mrs Pardoel and husband John were devastated by the loss of their only son.

Mrs Pardoel said she opposes the war. ""I think it's just cold-blooded murder. Look at all those young American boys that have been slaughtered,"" she said. ""I don't think this should have gone on ... He said to me one night he phoned, he said, 'Mum there's nowhere to hide here, it's just so dangerous, there's nowhere to hide'.""

Thirty-five year old Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel had been on his last flight when the C-130 Hercules he was aboard crashed north of Baghdad yesterday, killing ten personnel. He was serving with the British Royal Air Force (RAF), to which he had transferred several years ago from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), as Navigator in 47 Squadron Lyneham RAF.

Mr Pardoel had been expecting to return in July to his wife and three children in Australia, where they had recently bought a new house in Canberra.

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, says he is saddened to hear of the man's death.

""I want his family to know, and his friends to know, that he certainly did not die in vain, that this tragic accident occurred - or this tragedy because it may not have been an accident - but this tragedy occurred on a day when 65 per cent of the people of Iraq went out and voted,"" he said."
"Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found","in the Hell Creek Formation.
The discovery is being called one of the most complete and well-preserved soft tissue of a tyrannosaur rex. The new fossils could offer insights into what these carnivorous dinosaurs ate.
""We are not trying to show that we can determine exactly what an extinct organism ate,"" said David Giles of the University of New Hampshire.
""It would be great to do that. We can't. But what we can do is look at what was there. The point is to learn from what is in the","in a sandstone formation in Montana.

MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science.

Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. “Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.”, paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Richard A. Hengst of Purdue University said the finding ""opens the door for research into the protein structure of ancient organisms, if nothing else. While we think that nature is conservative in how things are built, this gives scientists an opportunity to observe this at the chemical and cellular level.""

Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said the discovery was ""pretty exciting stuff."" ""You are actually getting into the small-scale biology of the animal, which is something we rarely get the opportunity to look at."""
"Speaking in Texas, President Bush in a Wednesday address to the American Legislative Exchange Council in the city of Grapevine said, ""","The people of America are better off with me as their president than they would have been with John Kerry.
""I was re-elected for a reason and that is because we made a good record,"" Bush told a conservative crowd at a hotel ballroom.
In what could have been seen as a not so veiled attack on John Kerry, who has criticized Bush on many occasions over his policies on Iraq, Bush said:
""It is time for those in America to stand up for our troops. The terrorists can never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,","The violence in recent days in Iraq is a grim reminder of the enemies we face.""

""After September the 11th, I made a commitment to the American people that the United States of America will not wait to be attacked again."" Bush said. ""We will take the fight to the enemy, and we will defend our freedom.""

There has been debate within the Administration as to how to refer to the ongoing conflict. In recent appearances, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has avoided using the word ""war"", preferring the phrase ""global struggle against violent extremism."" Bush's speech marks a return to the existing phrase ""war on terror"". In the speech he acknowledged that the struggle is against those who use terror to achieve their goals, implicitly recognising that the term ""war on terror"" may be misleading.

""Make no mistake about it, this is a war against people who profess an ideology, and they use terror as a means to achieve their objectives,"" he said.

Of the military strategy in Iraq, Bush said that coalition forces continue to hunt down terrorists, and the Iraqi security forces are being trained to take on more responsibility. ""As Iraqis stand up, Americans and coalition forces will stand down,"" Bush said. ""And we're making progress. More and more Iraqi units are more and more capable of defending themselves.""

The return of American forces to U.S. soil will be event-driven decision, he said. A timetable for withdrawal is not practical because it would give the enemy a tactical event upon which to plan.

Politically, Iraq's National Assembly is working on a constitution that members pledged to have ready by August 15. The Iraqi people would then vote on the constitution October 15. If passed, the new Iraqi government under a constitution would be elected December 15.

The choice of Wolfowitz is raising controversy in Europe and developing nations.

Some question whether Wolfowitz, who was criticized for brushing aside European and NATO calls for caution before the Iraq war, would use the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as tool to extend U.S. foreign policy interests.

Historically, it has been the White House’s prerogative to name the candidate because the U.S. holds a majority on the 24 member board, but board members from nations other than the U.S. are seeking their own interviews to qualify the candidate before a change is made. ""The executive directors have agreed to conduct informal meetings over the coming days with the US nominee as part of the consultative process."" the IMF said in a statement.

Zardad denied all charges throughout the trials, and claimed he had been set up by enemies in Afghanistan.

""I have never killed anybody and if anybody in the whole of Afghanistan can produce that evidence against me then I will accept that crime,"" he said.

Despite the increase in the rate, Irish inflation remains very low - having hit 7% during 2000 and remaining around the 5% until the beginning of 2003. Another major factor easing any worries about the increase is Ireland's very strong GDP growth - expected to be around 5.5% this year

Oregon State University (OSU) animal researchers in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Dubois,"Regional Laboratory are using a $10 million federal grant to improve pork production through genetic manipulation of pigs to develop disease resistance, feed conversion and reproductive traits.
The five-year, USDA National Pork Board funded project is one of two studies being conducted by OSU that will use new tools from human genetic science to enhance pig performance. The other is a $3.8 million National Institutes of Health funded project aimed at reducing porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in pigs through manipulation of their genes.
In",", Idaho-based Sheep Experiment Station released a report on an OSU-USDA study which was initiated in 1995 after breeders asked the government to determine why some rams bought as breeding studs showed no interest in females. The researchers are working under a $2.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in hopes of developing a test which can determine the likelihood of a ram being female-oriented before it is sold as a stud.

By studying difference in the animal's brains after slaughter, the study also showed what could be a biological determiner for what makes a ram male-oriented instead of female-oriented sexually. The scientists' results showed that the anterior preoptic area of the rams' hypothalamus was 50 percent smaller in male-oriented rams as opposed to female oriented rams. A 1991 study of human brains of AIDS victims showed a similar hypothalamus size difference between gay and heterosexual men.

The sheep researchers postulate that low levels of aromatase hormones in the brain of a developing male sheep fetus may have kept the brain from fully masculinizing, leading to sexually male-oriented rams.

""This lends further support to the idea that homosexuality has biological underpinnings,"" Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology, said in an interview with the Corvallis Gazette-Times.

Professor Stormshak believes that ""understanding sexual drives and the continuum of sexual behavior could possibly help explain the scientific basis of sexual assault and put an end to assertions that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."""

The","ios Boeing 737 died when it crashed near Athens after flying from Cyprus. A text message, reportedly sent from the doomed aircraft, has also been revealed as a hoax.

Greek Chief Coroner Philippos Koutsaftis stated ""Until now I have done an autopsy on six bodies and first evidence is that when they were killed they had circulation in their heart and lungs.

""That does not mean that they were conscious but that they had breath and circulation. They had circulation and heartbeat so they were alive.""

Initial reports from the Greek Defence Ministry had suggested the bodies were ""frozen solid"" at the moment of impact.

The coroner stressed that as more post mortems were carried out new evidence may come to light.

Nothing is known about the cause of the disaster beyond the fact that everyone on board the airliner was incapacitated at some point, and that emergency oxygen masks had been used. Speculation abounds, with the theory that the airliner failed to maintain pressurisation at some point being the most popular theory.

Helios has said the aircraft was maintained in line with European regulations and had also received a standard inspection before take-off.

Greek police have also arrested a man who claimed his cousin texted him from the airliner, saying the pilots were blue in the face and that they were freezing. He was brought to the district attorney where two charges were filed against him, for lying to the authorities and for spreading false information, and a trial was scheduled. The man claimed that his intention was to gain publicity.

Police have also attended Helios's offices to requisition documents as part of the investigation into the disaster.

"The growing power of the Internet is clearly reflected in the decision, announced Tuesday, for the Associated Press to begin charging newspapers and broad","casters a fee to use their articles.
The change was not an overnight decision for AP. But with a new business plan that will have them charging $100 or $200 a month to online outlets that are members of their service, it has come at a time when many people are questioning whether news on the Web should be free.
AP is one of the two news wires used by the media to disseminate stories around the globe. The other is United Press International. Both organizations provide journalists with copy from member organizations such as The New York Times.
UPI","casters to post wire stories, photos, and other content on their online editions. The changes go into effect January 1, 2006. An advisory committee meeting will be held in the fall to ease the transition.

As the Internet draws more news consumers from traditional repositories of data, increasing numbers are demanding the stories on the Internet reflect the quick updating and coverage of a large wire network such as the Associated Press.

The rates the AP charges, known within as “assessments”, have risen by about 2.75 percent annually during the 90’s. Since the service is supposed to be not-for-profit and is owned by its customers, price increases are a tough sell.

The formula for the new calculations still has not been set, making it difficult to determine how the changes will affect what the outlets charge for their online news coverage. Currently the AP bases rates on newspaper circulation or broadcast audience with the large ones footing the major part of the bill.

The AP is creating a computer database of news paraphernalia which includes stories, photos, graphics, audio and video. It is all designed to make it easier for news rooms to create usable content."

Brazilian plastic artist Alexandre Linhares has written and is producing a 75 minutes play titled Jesus pra Cristo (Jesus for Christ,"), that will be shown on April 10, at the Theatro da Cidade.
The play was developed through research of the Gospels of Jesus in a rethinking of the plot.
In an interview to O Globo, he explained the theme:
""I thought a lot about Jesus’s life. He lived a long time and many people are not able to read all of his books. He said a lot of things that can help people live their lives. But what would have been Jesus’s message for our time? ""
According to him, Jesus did not come to change religion.","), containing homosexual themes and inspired by the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber.

In the play, Mary, the mother of Jesus is a transexual, Jesus is a punk revolting against the society, Mary Magdalene is a drug dealer, prostitute and homosexual, James is HIV positive and homosexual. The cast includes homosexual and transexual actors.

The plot begins with a 15 years old transexual (Mary) who sees a angel announcing she will conceive the Savior of the World. Later, Jesus begins to do miracles during World War III. Followers go after him. Jesus is charged with anarchism and condemned to death.

Alexandre Linhares, the author, tells how the play idea was born:
:Since I was a child I loved the play Opera-Rock Jesus Christ Superstar. Even my blog is after that name. I loved all the scenes of the film and I always wanted to see the spectacle at Broadway... However, the play that is scheduled to March originated during a time where my life was in a big turmoil, and I decided to post in my blog my idea about creating a play, based in that musical.

The play is scheduled to open March, 18, as part of the Theater Festival of Curitiba."
"Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced an Inquiry into the ""very regrettable incident"" of a mentally ill Australian woman being detained for","10 hours at Heathrow Airport on Friday.
The Prime Minister, who is on a two day visit to Britain, told a press conference:
""I can understand people being outraged by what has occurred and that is why we are launching a public Inquiry. The government will not accept in this day and age the possibility of such a situation being allowed to happen.
""We want to look at all aspects of it - from the procedures used by airlines at Heathrow to the procedures used by our security authorities when dealing with passengers at Heathrow. We are taking a very hard look","months and allegedly maltreated by the country's own Immigration Department.

The woman, Cornelia Rau, still insisted she was German Anna Schmidt, according to her sister Christine yesterday. ""I think it will take a long time for her to stabilise,"" she said. ""At the moment she doesn't accept that she is Cornelia and she doesn't want to see us.""

""She is still insisting her name is Anna Schmidt and that her passport is in Baxter and that she wants to return to Germany.""

Refugee advocate Pamela Curr claims Ms Rau was held in isolation for 18 to 20 hours a day in Baxter's 'Red One' isolation facility, where she was allegedly kept in simulated daylight for 24 hours a day.

Her family had only discovered her whereabouts through a refugee-initiated effort to identify the woman, authorities having failed to connect the unidentified detainee with her missing person file, held by New South Wales Police since August last year.

After her family recognised media reports of her on Thursday, and contacted the police, her photo was emailed to the Baxter compound and her identity confirmed.

The schizophrenic woman had spent six months in a Queensland prison, according to Channel Nine News, as well as at least two months in immigration detention, according to various sources. Earlier reports had her being handed over to immigration authorities over 10 months ago, with only five days spent in custody with Queensland Police.

Ms Rau is presently recuperating in hospital."

She is the third high-ranking government official to have died in a little over two months. Her husband, David Blunkett, lost a kidney to a blood disease. He resigned from government on 4 December. Margaret Thatcher’s husband Denis, who suffered from dementia for many years, died on 30 December.
The Prime Minister Tony Blair paid tribute to Mowlam by saying that her work was a great achievement and a great tragedy.
In a statement he said, ""I will always","in a hospice after a fall two weeks ago. She was 55.

In a statement, prime minister Tony Blair called her ""one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered. She was a natural politician, could read a situation and analyse and assess it as fast as anyone.""

Another former cabinet minister, Clare Short, said: ""She was a very beautiful young woman, she survived ill health and helped bring peace to Northern Ireland and now she's gone far too young.""

Mo Mowlam was central to the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and was popular in Britain for her straightforward approach, informality and honesty.

Ms Mowlam even received a standing ovation during prime minister Blair's speech during the 1998 Labour Party Conference.

Mo Mowlam retired from political life in 2001, but continued to make the headlines by realising her autobiography which was critical of Blair's presidential style of government.

It is thought that the fall that made her go to hospital, and then the hospice where she died, was due to a lack of balance caused by a brain tumour."

The cub is the second to be born in the United States this year. In Washington, Mei Xiang gave birth to a male panda cub at the National Zoo last month after artificial insemination.

According to Hall, early ultrasound images indicated Bai Yun was pregnant with twins. However, zoo personnel became suspicious that one fetus was no longer viable after veterinarians failed to detect a heartbeat in one cub last week. Bai Yun failed to give birth to a second cub Tuesday evening. ""It is likely that the second fetus died in utero and was reabsorbed by her body,"" Hall said.

Panda behavioral researchers will be watching the pair 24 hours a day for three weeks to record and assess the mother-infant relationship. The new cub has not yet been named. The gender of the cub will be unknown until zoo staff can safely check."

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palesinian President Mahmoud Abbas today declared an end to military and violent activities against each other,".
The statement is a breakthrough that could pave the way for a resumption of the stalled Mideast peace process, which was interrupted after a series of terrorist attacks by Palestinian extremists in late 2001.
In their statement, Sharon and Abbas called on all parties in the region to help them bring about a cessation of hostilities. The leaders said theirs would be a ""peace of blood"" that would not require concessions from either side.
Abbas is set to address the United Nations General Assembly Monday. He has promised that he will",". The two leaders made the expected announcement at a summit held at Shram el-Sheikh, Egypt, the first such meeting between the two sides in four years.

Prime Minister Sharon pledged to end military operations against Palestinians, and President Abbas similarly said that the Palestinians will likewise end ""all acts of violence against Israelis....wherever they are"". Both leaders expressed hope that the agreement will lead to long term peace in the long-running conflict. Prime Minister Sharon said that the agreement is part of the goal of ""quiet, dignified and peaceful lives for all the nations in the Middle East"". President Abbas said ""the calm that is currently prevailing in our territories signals the start of a new era, the start of a hopeful peace."" Both sides also confirmed their intent to create an independent Palestinian state. The talks became possible in the renewed optimism after the death of Yassir Arafat and the election of Abbas.

The agreement marks a profound change in Israeli-Palestinian relations, but the negotiated truce is a shaky peace. The ability of President Abbas to exert control over Palestinian militant groups is questionable, and thorny political issues remain for the Israelis if they begin to withdraw settlers from the occupied territories. There are signs that the Palestinian resistance groups are willing to participate in the cease-fire: the terrorist organisation, HAMAS released a statement in the hours before the summic stating that ""was prepared to calm down resistance raids in the event the Zionist entity reciprocated,"" referring to Sharon's pledge to stop military activities, yet shortly after the summit a spokesman for the organization said it will not be bound by the cease-fire.

The agreement includes a pledge by Israel to release 900 Palestinian prisoners, to create join committees on prisoner release and the withdrawal of troops from Palestinian territories, and cooperation with Palestinian security forces in occupied areas."
"The Israeli High Court has unanimously ruled that the controversial wall separating Israel from the West Bank should be rerouted.

","The court was told by a lawyer representing 10,000 Palestinian families who will lose their land to the barrier that it is being built along an indefensible and unnecessary route.

It is not the first time that the high court has criticized the government over the construction of the barrier.

In May the court said the barrier violates international law by cutting into occupied land.

The United Nations has called for a freeze on all work on the barrier.

The court gave the government two months to come up with a new plan.

The court","The panel of nine justices gave their ruling on a petition submitted by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and ordered that alternative routes be investigated around the settlement of Alefei Menashe. The court ruling orders that the existing wall in the area be demolished and rebuilt nearer to the settlement.

The rerouting of the wall will result in the Palestinian village of Qalqilya, and four others, being on the West Bank side of the barrier.

The barrier has been a contentious issue between Israelis and Palestinians since construction began. Israel's government ignored last year's non-binding ruling by the International Court of Justice which declared the barrier illegal."
Online US-based auction company eBay is in talks to acquire Voice-over-IP (VoIP) provider Skype,"for a figure that could reach $1.8bn, according to The Wall Street Journal.
eBay has held preliminary talks to purchase the online telephony business and plans to launch a public offering of stock by the end of 2005.
The two companies are not strangers as eBay was an investor in the start-up back in 2003 when it took a stake worth around $600,000.
In April of 2004 eBay increased its stake to around $100m after a further fund","for US$5 billion. Many believe that eBay intends to enter the rapidly expanding VoIP market and give recent entrants, Google and Microsoft, a run for their money.

The speculation that eBay may buy the small Luxembourg-based company sent their shares down four percent on Wall Street.

Last month, Rupert Murdoch, CEO of News Corporation, was in talks with Skype to possibly buy the company. The talks ended when Skype said the company was not for sale.

VoIP is becoming an increasingly significant threat to traditional telephone companies, since most calls between computers are free and some users wonder why a separate land line is still needed.

Hawi is the third prominent anti-Syrian figure to be assassinated in Lebanon, and the second this month.

The train crashed into the side of a nine-story apartment building located nearby a bend where it jumped the track. Relatives of those lost are arriving in Amagasaki to identify loved ones in a gymnasium where a makeshift morgue is located.

Police searching for the cause of yesterday’s disaster investigated eight offices of West Japan Railway Co on Tuesday for clues to the rail driver. Police conducting the probe said professional negligence may be involved. The train operator, who in the past received a warning for a similar incident, over-shot the stop at the previous station and had to back the train up nearly 40 m (130 feet).

It is unclear whether the inexperienced driver of the train survived, 23-year-old Ryujiro Takami with 11 months on the job.

Running late and traveling at what survivors thought was excessive speed, it is believed the train lost control at a bend in the track where 71 km/h (44 mph) was the speed limit; however, any speeds under 134 km/h (83 mph) should not have caused derailment.

The company is a member of the Fit Food group and plans to open around ten outlets in the next 18 months. The group was set up by two businessmen from Warsaw who met when both worked for McDonalds.
In 2005 Coffeeheaven opened a number of stores in Germany.

The investments will be covered by both parts in equal shares. We don't work in a franchise system."" Coffeeheaven also said that they would not open stores in shopping malls, but rather in the city centre or in main pedestrian streets.

Coffeeheaven, based in Warsaw, and opening its first store in 2000, is one of the largest coffee house chains in Central Europe and its surrounds. It currently has 28 outlets in Poland, 7 in Latvia (trading under the brand name Coffee Nation) and 3 in the Czech Republic."
"The state owned telephone monopoly in Costa Rica, the Costa Rica Electricity Institute, (ICE) has called for VoIP Internet to be made","legal.
The current legislation requires a license from ICE to offer telephony over the Internet and is being blamed by many of the high prices that are charged to use telecoms in the country.
In 2015 a court case found ICE was responsible for high telephone prices as a result of their refusal to issue VoIP licences to providers such as Skype.
The decision came after a number of people took a court case to try to have a law changed which required them to purchase a license to provide VoIP.
The judge said that it was up to the government","a criminal offence. In Costa Rica it has been illegal for anyone other than ICE to offer telephone services. With a reputation for preventing any rivals from challenging its monopoly, but also for providing an efficient service, ICE has recently seen its monopoly dented with as many as 20% of calls being routed through Skype and other VoIP service providers.

On the other hand those who seek to promote the software industry in Costa Rica, which already has a dominant 78% share of the market in Central America and the Caribbean, have reacted by saying the proposal would be disastrous both to software development and the country's ability to outsource work. The ICE claims that its telephone structure is being used by VoIP service providers, which is almost certainly true given that Skype offers calls from the Internet to phones in Costa Rica for 8 US$ cents per minute."

The BBC reported on January 27 that statistics released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health showed that Coalition forces killed 60% of the,"insurgents.
The numbers are a little hard to come by. But they have been estimated from various sources and we can give an order of magnitude for them.
Insurgent attacks:
A total of 1,815 insurgent attacks took place in 2003. Of those attacks 900 resulted in at least 1 dead.
This is about a 4.8 to 1 kill ratio.
Iraqis killed by insurgents:
1000 Iraqis died as a result of insurgent attacks.
Iraqis","civilians that died in the period July 2004 to January 2005.

The figures, normally available only to the Iraqi cabinet, show a total of 3,274 Iraqi civilians were killed and 12,657 wounded during the continuing conflict. These figures exclude the deaths of known insurgents.

However according to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, the BBC misunderstood the matter. According to the previous story from BBC these figures were a result of Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces military operations.

However, the Iraqi Ministry of Health explained that the published figures also include Iraqis killed by terrorists, not only those killed by Coalition forces or Iraqi security forces; and that those recorded as killed in military action included terrorists themselves, and Iraqi security forces.

The BBC recognized their error and apologized in a recent news item, and retracted the conclusions drawn by their original report:

""The BBC regrets mistakes in its published and broadcast reports yesterday,"" reported the BBC.""

The figures, based on records from Iraqi public hospitals released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health, are shown in the following table:

Shortly before the release of the figures by the BBC, US Ambassador John Negroponte had told BBC reporter John Simpson:

""My impression is that the largest amount of civilian casualties definitely is a result of these indiscriminate car bombings."""
In an address to the ongoing conference of Asian and African nations Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi offered apologies for the suffering caused by Japanese,"troops in China, Taiwan, the Philippines, and elsewhere. He said he was offering a sincere apology from his heart.
The statement is part of Japan’s attempt to improve ties with other Asian and Pacific Rim countries that suffered at the hands of Japanese troops. The United States has been pressuring Japan to offer such a statement since 1995 when President Clinton met with victims of Japanese atrocities.
In a statement after the address Koizumi said:
I will work toward improving our relations with all Asian and Pacific countries through concrete efforts that are not limited to making statements","aggression in the 1930s and 40s.

""In the past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility,"" after this Koizumi added that the Japanese people have ""feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology.""

Koizumi's apology was the first apology offered by a Japanese leader for its country's past in the presence of such a large number of government leaders from different countries."
"Commander Leroy Chiao (U.S.A.) and Flight Engineer Salizhan Sharipov (Russia), suited","for a spacewalk on the International Space Station
The two astronauts of the 10th long-term expedition to the International Space Station are going outside on their second spacewalk in four days. The spacewalkers have installed an ammonia pump on the P6 truss, unfurled a high-definition TV camera on a boom, and inspected a docking mechanism that is not used by space shuttles.
Commander Leroy Chiao of the U.S.A. and Flight Engineer Salizhan Sharipov of the Russian space agency are we","in Russian Orlan spacesuits, left the International Space Station on a 4.5 hour long spacewalk to install antennas for the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), inspect and photograph other exterior equipment and launched the Nanosatellite mini-satellite. This is the last scheduled walk for the Expedition 10 crew.

At 06:25 UTC, the two astronauts left the station from the Pirs DC1 docking compartment/airlock and proceeded to install the last three of six space-to-space communication antennas for the ATV's rendezvous and docking with the ISS next year.

Sharipov next deployed the foot long, 11 pound Russian Nanosatellite, tossing it into space by hand. The object of the experiment is to develop small satellite control techniques, monitor satellite
operations and develop new attitude system sensors. Russian ground crews reported good signal reception from the satellite two hours after its release.

The two astronauts next proceeded to the aft end of the Zvezda service module. A Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna and necessary cabling for the ATV was installed and the men worked their way back to the airlock.

The station maintained its attitude, despite the loss of a gyroscope earlier in the space station mission, until the end of the spacewalk. Chiao and Sharipov reported being a safe distance from the attitude adjustment thrusters. Russian ground control activated the jets and normal attitude of
the station was regained.

They returned to the airlock at 1055 UTC, completing the mission an hour earlier than scheduled.

Chiao and Sharipov arrived on the station October 16, 2004. They are scheduled to return to Earth on April 25, 2005. This marks Sharipov's second walk in space and Chiao's sixth."

The New Zealand Labour Party announced its party list admidst speculations it may call an early election. The election must be held before Sept 24,", the day that a bye-election will take place to fill a seat left vacant when David Shearer resigned in April to join UNICEF as their NZ spokesperson.
The new list is dominated by women with only five of the first twenty being men. Of those five, four are from Māori electorates and one is the husband of a former Prime Minister.
There is some controversy around the decision to not have a number two on the list. Some commentators believe this was a deliberate attempt by Andrew Little to weaken his leadership challenge. Others suggest","2005. The list ranking is often seen as a ranking of the importance for each politician to the party.

Hon. Parekura Horomia was ranked at number five, the highest ranking of any Maori MP. The Maori MPs face a strong challenge from the newly formed Maori Party. Shane Jones, the highest placed non-MP, is all but assured of a seat in the next Parliament. Steven Ching is placed at 42, and represents Labour's interest in courting the Asian vote. The Asian population has grown significantly over the past ten years within New Zealand.

The surprising absentee is Hon. George Hawkins, the Minister of Police. He has been criticised for performing poorly in the House, and it is speculated he was offered a low ranking and refused. He is likely to return to Parliament on the basis of his strong hold on the Manurewa electorate seat.

At the time, no other major political party has released its list.

New Zealand changed its electoral system to MMP in 1996, before then it used FPP. In the 2002 election, Labour won 52 seats. Labour then became government in a minority coalition. Elections are held every three years in New Zealand."
Volunteers began a 60 day bed-rest marathon on March 19 to study simulated weightlessness effects on women astronaut,"s.
The test is the second of two studies by NASA that are expected to help develop procedures for space station construction, space walks and other manned space flight missions. The test will evaluate how well female astronauts can maintain their bodies in space for extended periods.
A total of 48 women from around the United States have been accepted into the program. Each woman will live in a small room at a University of Texas Hospital. She will not be allowed to stand up or walk. A treadmill will provide all her exercise.
She will receive meals through a stomach tube to control","s. The study, Women International Space Simulation for Exploration(WISE), is conducted at the MEDES Space Clinic in Toulouse, France.

The 12 women, selected from 1600 applicants hailing from France,Great Britain, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic began the study after a 20 day screening for baseline comparison data as the study progressed.

The women will conduct all activities from eating, bathing, and reading while lying in hospital beds tilted headfirst at a six degree angle. This particular position, called head-down tilt bed rest was determined from previous studies to remove the vertical load of gravity on the body, inducing changes similar to what astronauts in a genuine weightless environment experience .

Long term exposure to weightlessness creates a number of physiological and psychological problems in astronauts such as:
*Reduced capacity for physical exertion
*Muscle atrophy
*Affects of confinement and isolation
*Impaired circulatory function

A total of 24 women will participate in the study. A second group of 12 will join in September.

Three groups of eight women each will be studied over the course of the two campaigns of bed rest. One group will serve as a control, receiving no specific treatments, the second will exercise, while the third will receive nutritional supplements.

The study is designed to fill in gaps of knowledge on the differences between men and women during extended weightlessness. It also aims to develop countermeasures for reducing the debilitating effects of long spaceflights.

Participating agencies in the study include the European Space Agency, NASA, the French Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency."

"Vladimir Putin has relieved from power Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the head of the Russian navy. This comes a month after an incident","on a submarine that caused 20 deaths and injuries to several people.
The president announced his decision at a meeting in Moscow with members of the State Duma Defence Committee. He said he was sacking the commander for poor work organization on a nuclear-powered cruiser of the Peter the Great class. The ship is one of the newest vessels of the Russian fleet.
In April a fire broke out on a cruiser of this class. A total of 180 servicemen were rescued. According to official information, the cause of the accident was a fire on a p","where 7 Russian sailors became trapped in a submarine, and had to be rescued with help from abroad.

No reason was given for Kuroyedov's dismissal, although Admiral Eduard Baltin speculated on Moscow Radio that it may be because of the navy chief's poor health. According to Reuters, he told Ekho Moskvy: ""He has been lying in hospital for two months, he had a complicated operation.""

Admiral Kuroyedov was in charge of the navy during the Kursk disaster of 2000, in which 118 sailors died when their submarine sank. Kuroyedov is being replaced by Vladimir Masorin, who was previously serving as the Chief of staff for the Russian Navy.

In remarks Putin made about this leadership change and referring to Masorin, he said ""The recent exercises, including those I have attended, show that the navy is developing and that is certainly your merit to a large extent."" Putin also added ""at the same time, there were difficult events, tragedies, but I would like to underline once again that with all these problems, all these tragedies, the main thing is that the Navy is undergoing a revival.""

Masorin added while in a hall at the Admiralty, ""One thing is clear — to continue in the condition which we are in and do nothing is simply not possible. I have been given the task of stopping the navy shaking public opinion. I am not experiencing euphoria at being appointed head of the navy. I understand the level of responsibility on my shoulders."""
"The European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty on April 13
The President of Romania, Traian Băs","escu, stated in a press release that he is going to bring the Accession Treaty back from Brussels. He announced this decision at a press conference where he talked about his first day as president and about his government program.
""I have brought back from Brussels the Accession Treaty for the European Union. The treaty has not been voted by the European Parliament. We are going to vote for it on April 13"", Traian Băsescu said.
According to Traian Băsescu, he was told by European officials that there would not be a new debate","escu, met yesterday with Jonathan Scheele, the head of the European Commission's Delegation to Bucharest, as well as with several European parliamentarians (MEPs). The parties discussed Romania's accession to the EU, which is particularly important as the Accession Treaty is scheduled to be signed late this month, after being voted on by the European Parliament on April 13.

Băsescu told the delegation that European integration remains Romania's first priority at the moment, and that after negotiations were closed with the EU in December 2004, accession became a matter of internal politics rather than foreign affairs.

The MEPs talked to Băsescu about public opinion regarding EU accession in Romania, as well as the impact of accession on the rural population. Judging from recent polls, the overwhelming majority of Romania's population approve EU accession, even though this may be partly due to the fact that many of them have not been adequately informed of the costs of accession. The parliamentarians also discussed the environment and the situation in neighbouring countries, especially Moldova. Tourism was also discussed in the context of promoting Romania's image to European Union citizens.

The delegation also discussed with Băsescu a key issue in Romania's accession process: judicial reform. The Romanian President told the MEPs that Romania has taken bold steps to reform its judiciary and fight corruption. There is also progress towards forming an anti-corruption department within the Internal Ministry of Romania.

As part of Romania's foreign policy, Băsescu also said that, once a member of the European Union, Romania would act as an advocate for other Southeastern European states wishing to join the organisation, as well as seeking to attract public attention to the broader Black Sea region. Romania and Bulgariaare the most advanced countries in Southeastern Europe in terms of EU integration, and will therefore be the first countries in this region to join the 25-nation bloc."
The Romanian Government has made plans and identified its aims for the next privatisation program which will end in 2006. By the,"end of 2001, it is estimated that 80 per cent of state enterprises will have been sold or closed.
The programme was agreed after talks with the European Union on December 5.
The plan sets out three key areas.
The first area will see a further reduction of state shareholding in publicly-owned enterprises to no more than 49 per cent by 2003.
The second will focus on improving the financial situation of publicly-owned enterprises through their reorganisations. The third will look at improving their performance","end of next year, the government hopes to sell all of its shares in Romtelecom, Romania's largest telecommunications company, which is currently owned by Greece's OTE but which the government maintains a 47% share in. The full privatisation will occur in two phases, with some of the government's existing shares being sold on the Bucharest Stock Exchange this year, and the remainder being sold in 2006.

By 2006, the government also wants to sell its share in Postelecom, another telecommunications operator, and complete the privatisation of the Radiocomunicaţii, the national radio communications company.

The Government also wantes to begin analysis and consulting into the privatisation of Poşta Română, or Romanian Post, the full privatisation of which is set to be completed by 2009 at the latest.

Romania has embarked on a quite comprehensive program of privatisation since 2000, having privatised a part of Romtelecom, as well as full privatisations of several energy distributors and the nation's largest banks, in addition to other smaller companies. However, these privatisations are dwarfed by that of Petrom, Romania's national oil company, which was bought by Austria's OMV in 2004 and is the largest Romanian privatisation ever.

The current Liberal-Democrat governing coalition in Romania has privatisation and economic liberalism as one of its main policies, having also introduced a 16% flat tax rate for personal income and corporate profits at the start of 2005."

The Coalition of University Employees accuses top UC officials of ignoring the union's requests regarding the high turnover rate of researchers. CUE organizers say the university is misleading the union about the quantity of money readily available for employee salary increases.

The UC officials deny accusations that they have bargained in bad faith, saying they have offered a contract to the researchers that's similar to an approved deal.

Samsung announced it will market DVD players capable of playing back both Sony's Blu-Ray and Toshiba's HD DVD next,"year.
The Korean company is the world's second largest TV maker after Sanyo of Japan, which was the first to launch a player that can read both formats.
Toshiba has been struggling to boost sales of the high definition disc, while rival Blu-ray backers are targeting 10 million players by 2008.
""We plan to offer a player in 2006,"" a spokeswoman at Samsung told AFP.
She would not comment on when or at what price.
A source at a Japanese company with ties to the","-generation optical storage formats, if the two camps refuse to compromise on a single format. Assuming development is successful, consumers could expect to see such a device on store shelves next year.

Blu-Ray and HD DVD are projected to be the successor formats for current DVDs. Samsung, while leaning towards the Blu-Ray camp, hopes it can cover both bases by distributing a player with dual-compatibility. While this means spending more in development to unify the two technologies and develop a cost-effective production method, dual compatibility may pay off for the company if the formats challenge each other as VHS and Betamax did twenty-five years ago. Despite the support for Blu-Ray, Samsung has also been supportive of a unified standard to avoid such costly competition.

HD DVD offers single layer capacity of 15GB, more than triple the size of standard single layer DVDs, and benefits from similarities with current DVDs, such as cheap production and compatibility with current DVD players. Blu-Ray can hold 23GB on its smallest single layer version, and is reported to have superior durability and interactivity over current DVD-based technology and HD-DVD. HD-DVD is currently promoted by Toshiba, NEC, Sanyo and Microsoft; while Blu-Ray's base of support is the Blu-Ray Disc Association, which is led by Blu-Ray developers Sony and Philips. It is notable that Sony and Philips, who developed the Blu-Ray format, also competed against the Toshiba-designed SuperDisc DVD standard, which is the standard that is followed today.

The first Blu-Ray and HD DVD products are expected to start appearing in mainstream markets within the next year."

Their transfer cost was 16 and 4 million euros respectively, making this the most expensive transfer deal in Russian football. The head of Dinamo's board of directors, Alexey Fedorychev, is among the wealthiest Russian businessmen and he is responsible for making the money available to the club. Another Dinamo transfer target is the Greek footballer Seitaridis, also playing for Porto, but this deal has not yet been confirmed.

Meanwhile, in a Russian Premier League match Saturday with Amkar Perm Dinamo Moscow suffered its fourth defeat in a row 1-2, dropping to 9th place. Amkar (one of the poorest teams in Premier League) on the other hand, won the second match in a row. Despite conceding an early goal, Amkar was able to fight back, score from a penalty and secure a slender lead to win the away game.

Despite numerous signings between seasons and hiring a new coach, Oleg Romantsev, Dinamo's performance is far from the best. Last season saw them at 14th place (out of 16), barely avoiding relegation, and the start of a new season isn't promising either. It is yet to be seen, whether the new signings can help the club join the ranks of the top RPL teams, such as Lokomotiv Moscow and CSKA Moscow."
"Irish low fares airline, Ryanair, this week celebrated its 20th birthday. Having reached the milestone, the airline prompt","ly announced a further reduction in ticket prices of up to 15%.
The carrier was set up by two young men from Cork and is now Europe’s largest low-fares carrier with over 80 million passengers flown on their fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft. The company employs around 600 people at their European bases with plans for further expansion over the next decade.

The airline was founded in 1985 by the Irish businessman, Dr Tony Ryan. It began its existence flying a small 15 seat aircraft between Waterford and London Gatwick with the small aim of breaking the duopoly on London-Ireland flights, held at that time by British Airways and Aer Lingus. Today however, the airline now flies to over 200 European destinations with its fleet of 84 Boeing 737's and is awaiting the arrival of a future 225 aircraft from Boeing.

The company today carries as much as 3m passengers a month (depending on the season) and has revealed it made a profit of €245m (USD$307,916,000) in the past year. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated that the airline will carry over 70m passengers annually within five years. The notoriously eccentric Mullingar man went on to tell the press ""The very fact that a Mickey Mouse Irish airline can start in a field in Waterford 20 years ago and in 20 years overtake the world's self-styled, self proclaimed favourite airline is testament to the almost unstoppable demand for low airfare travel around Europe.""

To demonstrate the huge drop in airfares over the last year, the company claimed while the price of a Ryanair seat had dropped from £99.99 in 1985 to 99p today, the price of a pint of beer had trebled and the average house price in England had increased by 500%."

The government said on Sunday that a specialist from the Interior and Justice Ministry traveled to the city of Florencia to verify that the woman is with the guerrillas.
Urbina is one of 10 people being held in the area since May 30. He has not been heard from since he was detained by FARC members who came into a community where he lived to look for food.

Now, after his identification, Colombian officers expects he can be extradicted to Colombia. In Colombia, Chiguiro is expected to be judged for the alleged crimes of kidnapping and murderer of the American missionaries Sthephen Everet and Thimoty Dike in 1995.

Some Venezuelan baseball players from the Major Leagues said that kidnapping is a new situation they must learn to live with. None of them said that the risk of kidnappings would prevent their return to Venezuela.

For years, Venezuelan cattlemen near Colombian borders say that they are victims of extorsion by FARC forces. This is the first time that the Venezuelan government recognizes that the FARC is responsible by this kind of crime in Venezuela.

According to the Colombian authorities, Chiguiro is envolved with the exchange of drugs by weapons with Brazilian traffic drug dealers."

In a scene repeated across much of America, each morning a group of day laborers, mostly immigrants, assemble by a 7-Eleven convenience store in the hopes of getting work.

Each day, nearly 200 people gather near the nation's capital in Herndon, Virginia; these laborers do much of the hard and dangerous work not wanted by most U.S. citizens. This daily gathering has drawn both the ire and compassion of the Herndon community. A public hearing Monday night to discuss a new plan drew an overflowing crowd to the Town Council chambers. The Commission said so many people signed up to speak at the hearing that the panel will need to convene again Tuesday night.

For years groups and businesses among the community who want to help the day laborers have been working on the issue. In a plan spearheaded by Bill Threlkeld, of the group Project Hope and Harmony, they lobbied Herndon officials to use taxpayer money to build a regulated day laborer center in an old police station at the edge of town. This they say would get the day-laborer group(s) off the street. The plan has the backing of Herndon mayor, Michael L. O'Reilly.

The plan would also combine the opening of the center with a new local ordinance that would make it a misdemeanor crime for a laborer to seek work at any location other than the official one. Opponents of the plan say the town would be aiding illegal immigrants if it established the center.

A Pew Hispanic Center survey found a 25% increase over four years in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The number now is estimated to have reached about 10.3 million. Local governments do not have the authority to enforce national immigration laws, so the town of Herndon must rely on federal officials, who show little interest in getting involved."

In the images, released through Internet forums, soldiers are humiliated by their officers, being forced to act like dogs with other soliders holding their leashes. The Defence Forces communications director Ossi Kervinen considers the matter unfortunate.

The images are strikingly similar to those that came out of the Abu Ghraib prison last year.

U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema accepted would-be hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui's guilty pleas on,"five terrorism conspiracy counts in a federal court in Alexandria on Friday, paving the way for his possible death penalty.
The judge told Moussaoui that if he is found to have been responsible for a plot to use planes as missiles to destroy prominent American landmarks, he could face a possible death penalty. She scheduled a May 10 sentencing date and said Moussaoui will not face a possible life term without parole.
In exchange for Moussaoui's guilty plea, federal prosecutors dropped their insanity claim against Moussaou","six charges of conspiracy laid against him for his plotting to participate in the Sept. 11 attacks. Moussaoui, who had to be restrained at one point during the trial in an Alexandria, Virginia courthouse, was polite and quiet during the day's appearance.

36-year-old Moussaoui, a French citizen, faces the death penalty or life in prison in the sentencing phase of his trial. The prosecution has also asked that Moussaoui be forced to pay restitution to the victims of the attack.

19 hijackers took control of four planes on September 11, 2001. Nearly four weeks before the attack, Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota on immigrations charges having raised the suspicions of instructors at a flight school.

Qatar Airways will become the launch operator for the aircraft when it is introduced in 2023.
Airbus said that it expected the aircraft to open new world-wide destinations with flights up to 4,000 nautical miles longer.

The Italian government is against censoring porn, saying that people are free to make up their own mind and not being told what is or is not allowed.
In 2015 the European Court of Justice decided in a landmark case that member states can require providers to take active steps to protect children from violent porn.

The results of this years survey won't be available for some weeks, but geologists have come to some conclusions based on the past four years of monitoring. The intial discovery was made by using information from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Interferometric Satellite Aperture Radar satellite. Scientists believe the bulge is rising at a rate of 1.4 inches per year and is due to a large lake of fluid (likely magma) that is 4.5 miles below the surface. They also think the fluid covers an area about one mile across and extends to a depth of 65 feet. The pooling fluid could be shifting magma or the creation of a new volcano.

Ground swells aren't an extraodinary occurrence in geology. Geologists suspect that these ground swellings occur in the Cascade Range and at other volcanoes, and the majority of them do not lead to eruptions. Using the same ESA satellite technology, geologists have seen lots of bulges in the Aleutian Islands that have not lead to eruptions."

""We look forward","arest, the Romanian capital, to Arad, a city in the country's west, will be cancelled, due to lack of financial viability and an increase in competition. The reason for the cancellation is mainly due to the planned inauguration on May 16 of a Bucharest-Arad flight operated by the private airline Carpatair, Romania's second-largest airline.

Carpatair has grown very quicly in the past two years, adding several new destinations, both in Romania and abroad. Also, it has taken away many of TAROM's customers on international routes because it provides direct connections from Transylvanian cities such as Arad and Timişoara to German and Italian cities, saving customers the task of changing flights at Bucharest. Also, although Carpatair started out as a Transylvanian airline, it now also flies to destinations in Romania's east, and is expected to open up new routes via Bucharest, in a further attempt to compete with TAROM and win more market share.

A World Health Organization (WHO) committee comprising of 43 African health ministers has declared a tuberculosis emergency on the,"continent.
The decision was announced by Zambia’s Minister of Health, Dr. Chitalu Chilufya at a two day high-level conference that opened in Abuja on Friday.
Chilufya said that the high number of new tuberculosis cases being diagnosed on the continent is worrying and called for a coordinated and well funded approach to fighting the disease.
The high-level meeting will bring together government officials from member states as well as development partners to develop strategies aimed at controlling tuberculosis on the continent.
Tuberculosis is one","continent.

The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in African countries per year has quadrupled since 1990, and continues to rise. Now 540,000 people die of the disease in Africa every year.

Worldwide, TB kills two million people a year; the only deadlier disease in the world is HIV/AIDS.

Some African countries such as Tanzania and Malawi pioneered TB control strategies that were later adopted around the globe. But they were not successful - Malawi saw the number of TB cases a year rise by four times over the past 15 years. Poverty, poor health systems and HIV have been blamed by the WHO for this.

Funding is a particularly critical issue. Eight of the nine worst affected African countries reported that, for 2003, they had short-falls in the funding their TB control programmes needed. However the WHO stresses that money alone will not end the crisis - health systems must be improved, and the rate at which health professionals are lost in the region must be reduced.

Africa is the only region in the world to be experiencing an increase in TB cases - in the rest of the world, infection rates are either stable or falling."

Meanwhile, Ramallah has accused Lebanese rebel group Hezbollah of attempting to sabotage the fragile peace agreement in the Middle East. The group, backed by Syria and Iran, are attempting to recruit Palestinian militants to engage in attacks of Israeli targets, claim Palestinian spokesmen. The charges mirror those made recently by Israel, which has long accused Hezbollah of bankrolling Palestinian violence in the region.

Hezbollah denies the charges, and claims to be honouring the ceasefire agreed yesterday. However, Palestinian officials claim to have intercepted bank records and email communications that prove that the guerilla group is recruiting militants in the West Bank. Abbas is shying away from any confrontation with the group at the moment, but has sent an envoy to Beirut to persuade Hezbollah to desist from its aggressive activities.

Despite the setbacks, Israel has begun to lift restrictions of travel and issue permits to 1000 Palestinians to work in Israel, as part of Tuesday's deal. Sharon has agreed to travel to Ramallah to continue talks toward peace in the region."

He said National has no plans","live televised debate between the two leaders in the New Zealand general election of 2005.

A studio audience contained equal numbers of National and Labour Party supporters.

The debate ran through tax, race relations, foreign affairs, immigration, education and health (all the key policy areas).

Taxes were at the top of the agenda; the debate was just hours after the National Party released their tax policy.

Don Brash said that the nuclear freeze policy of New Zealand (which bans nuclear powered US warships from its ports) and Helen Clark's criticism of the war in Iraq have both contributed to her failure to secure a free-trade pact with the United States.

Helen Clark was confident and aggressive and she often forced Don Brash into defensive explanations of National's policies."
"New mass grave was discovered in a cave in Klina region, Kosovo. According to UNMIK's report, the remains are probably of non","-Serbian victims from 1998/1999.
The International Court of Justice is going to hold public hearings on 30.6. and 1.7.2005 regarding the lawfulness of the use of force by the NATO against Serbia. The court has accepted a request for provisional measures by Serbia.
According to a statement by Serbian Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic, Serbian security services have identified two people responsible for the bomb attack on a church in Pancevo on 10.","-Albanian victims, killed in Kosovo during the war in 1998.

According to B92 there are around 46 bodies of people from villages Retimlje, Opteruša and Zočište.

A warning has been sent out by Osama Bin Laden's lieutenant Ayman al-Zawahri saying that more attacks will be carried out,". He was speaking at a time of high tension after an attack on a hotel in Pakistan left 10 people dead, and two explosions at a church in Pampanga, the Philippines.
The statement came from Zawahri who is thought to have been injured in a raid by American special forces on a house in Pakistan where he was being sheltered. The man is a well-known face to those following the terrorist organisation al Qaida. He is one of the leaders who are responsible for planning many attacks around the world. He was involved in the bombing of two US embassies in","because of Tony Blair's foreign policy decisions.

The comments were from a videotape shown on the satellite television channel al-Jazeera. The message said was: ""Blair has brought you destruction to the heart of London, and he will bring more destruction, God willing.""

Al-Zawahri also warned other nations to leave Muslim lands to avoid further violence. He was quoted as saying: ""What you have seen, O Americans, in New York and Washington and the losses you are having in Afghanistan and Iraq, in spite of all the media blackout, are only the losses of the initial clashes, If you continue the same policy of aggression against Muslims, God willing, you will see the horror that will make you forget what you had seen in Vietnam.""

Tony Blair has denied that his policies caused the July 7 bomb attacks. Downing Street has refused to comment on the tape.

The FDA is notifying all Guidant Corp. defibrillator users to have a new generator installed by their doctors after receiving 100 complaints that the devices can stop working and are at risk for sudden failure. The agency has been monitoring Guidant since May when it was warned about problems with some defibrillators.
Guidant makes defibrillators used to help people who are having heart attacks by giving an electric shock. Guidant said there is a small possibility the generator could stop working. Guidant is asking the company to install a","a week about the devices. No patients are known to have been injured by the devices at this time. This brings the total number of defibrillator models recalled to twelve.

According to the Associated Press article, the five defibrillator models recalled ""have a magnetic switch that can become stuck in a closed position, preventing the device from treating irregular heart rhythms. The faulty switch also can limit a defibrillator's battery life.""

American manufacturing giant Proctor &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) plans to acquire Gillette Co. for US$5,"7 billion, a deal that is expected to create the world’s largest consumer products company with estimated 2001 sales of $40.8 billion. P&amp;G will issue about 0.6930 of its common stock for each outstanding share of Gillette and will pay an estimated $111 in cash for each Gillette share.
The two companies have been negotiating a possible merger since December. But talks stalled over P&amp;G’s demands to control Gillette’s management. After months of back and forth negotiations","7 billion in stock. The purchase plan calls for P&amp;G to swap 0.975 shares of its stock per share of Gillete Co. P&amp;G also announced a stock buyback program in which they would purchase up to US$22 billion of shares over the next 18 months. Including the stock buyback program, the merger is being financed by 60 percent stock and 40 percent cash.

P&amp;G is known for brands such as Ariel and Tide washing powder, Max Factor cosmetics, Pringles potato crisps (chips) and Hugo Boss and Lacoste perfumes.

Gillette, known for brands such as Gillette razors, Oral B dental care, and Duracell batteries, has had growing problems with the growth of private labels and price cuts demanded by large supermarkets.

After the acquisition is completed, Gillette's CEO James Kilts will be P&amp;G's vice-chairman. Kilts said that he expects that this acquisition will cause additional mergers to take place.

""I believe the consumer product industry needs to consolidate,"" said Kilts, ""we believe we can bring these companies together and create a juggernaut.""

P&amp;G and Gillette have a combined market capitalization of about $185 billion US, which will make it the largest in the sector.

The early morning announcement states that 6,000 employees will be eliminated. Most of the layoffs will result from reducing overlapping management positions and other supporting positions within the combined company.

Antitrust regulators in the US and Europe plan to review the acquisition, to determine whether the combined company will have too much power over pricing and shelf space.

P&amp;G plans to provide additional details about the merger Friday morning (East Coast time) in New York."
Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was officially placed under house arrest a day after the country's Supreme Court upheld his,"15-year prison term.
Pinochet, who is suffering from dementia and has not been seen in public for over two months, will remain at the military hospital where he is being cared for by doctors.
The decision came as thousands of people protested against Pinochet outside his former presidential palace.
Chile has been shaken by protests against Pinochet since a court found the ex-dictator guilty of the kidnap, torture and murder of a student.
A small number of Pinochet's supporters have held nightly","indictment of one count of murder and nine counts of kidnapping.

Court officials say the arrest order was delivered to Gen. Pinochet's home near the capital, Santiago, Wednesday. The 89-year-old retired general has been at his home recovering from a stroke he suffered in late December.

A government commission, the Rettig Commission, listed 2,095 deaths and 1,102 disappearances during his 17-year rule. In 2004 the Valech Report that was issued after interviewing an estimated 35,000 people who claimed to have been abused by the regime; 28,000 were regarded legitimate.

The crimes were allegedly committed as part of Operation Condor, a campaign of assassination and terrorization meant to suppress left-wing opposition to Pinochet's regime. The Chilean-led program soon spread to other military regimes throughout Latin America, and may have had at least tacit complicity by then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The Pinochet dictatorship ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990, gaining power after a military coup overthrew the democratically-elected socialist President Salvador Allende."
"Berlin's Neukoellner Opera House is causing a stir with its new production, The Yellow Princess.

The story presented in the","production is that of a Chinese emperor who was overthrown by a rebel prince and has to live as a woman for ten years. He is allowed to go back to being a man at the end of that time.

The show opened on December 10 and will continue through to April.

The German press have been full of comment about this show which seems to be taking Germany by storm.

In particular there are those who believe it is insensitive to use such a plot when China is dealing with a current outbreak of SARS.

A statement from the company has said:","French opera, by Camille Saint-Saens, is of an artist ""whose life is dictated by a love for drugs and Japan."" As a result, the performers smoke cannabis joints on stage, and the theatre itself is encouraging the audience to join in.

Artistic director Bernhard Glocksin says that the theatre is claiming the metaphorical ""artistic licence"", to excuse the actions of the actors and audience, which are against German law. Glocksin was quoted by Ananova as saying opera would be ""improved with a few joints and some appetising lines"", noting the production was partly an experiment, to see what they could ""get away with.""

""Artistic licence"" is at par to an ""artistic liberty"", where something is exaggerated or changed for the sake of the art itself. For example a visual artist painting a landscape might move a tree to another area of their work, for better balance, or a poet ignoring pentameter when writing a traditional sonnet."
"A chemical part of the saliva of a poisonous lizard, the Gila monster, has become an integral partner in the control of Type ","1 diabetes.
The drug is being used by people with diabetes to lower their insulin doses and improve blood glucose control. The drug was initially found by Dr. Walden from Arizona. He isolated a small part of saliva of Gila monster that contained a hormone which can help diabetic people by reducing insulin.
A new research on Gila monster has shown that it contains a small part of the saliva of this reptile. The discovery was done by a group of scientists at the University of Utah.
It is not a c","2 diabetes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved its use for people who have not achieved adequate control of their diabetes with oral medications.

Byetta, or exenatide, is produced by Amylin Pharmaceuticals. It is injected before eating morning and evening meals as part of a combination treatment with oral drugs. The FDA said it could be approved as a stand-alone treatment if the drug companies can support such use with data.

In mainland China, the China Daily published an editorial under the headline, ""March sets stage for secessionist scheming"" in which it labeled the rally as ""secessionist scheming"" and a ""misuse of people power"".

China Daily said of President Chen that, ""his participation in the protest added to his record as a man of bad faith. Only one month ago, Chen solemnly pledged to develop cross-Straits relations during his meeting with PFP chairman James Soong. Unfortunately he has failed to honour his word.""

In Taiwan, former President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝) asked for the ROC government to follow up on the large turnout with concrete measures.

The Taipei Times quoted Lee, ""The March 26 march ended perfectly, yet it wasn't just the close of a political carnival."" Lee continued, ""It was a new starting point for consolidating people's identification with Taiwan and declaring the Taiwanese people's strong will to defend their right of self-determination.""
""That 1 million Taiwanese people came out was a display of the mainstream of Taiwanese public opinion, and officials should respond to that with practical actions and policies,"" Lee told a symposium. ""Otherwise the march will just have been emotional venting, which won't solve the current cross-strait problems.""

"The new leader of Togo, the late president Gnassingbé Eyadéma's son, Faure Gnassingb","é, was declared President on April 5. He is a member of the Union for the Republic, a conservative party that has held power for over four decades.
The military government was accused by many opposition parties of manipulating the vote to give them an outright majority and allowing their candidate to become President.
Togo was one of the only West African states not to join the 14 other members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union in a single currency by 2000.
In 1980 the French colony of Togo became a republic with Gnass","é, pledged to hold ""free and transparent elections which reflect the will of the people"" as soon as possible, though he did not mention a specific timeframe, nor did he address international criticism of his ascession to power.

Togolese politics have become a subject of criticism by the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations after the death of Eyadéma late last week. Eyadéma was Africa's longest-ruling leader whose 38-year rule was marked by government-sponsored violence and the stifling of political expression.

The Constitution of Togo was amended to permit Eyadéma to retain power, to allow more than two five-year terms in office, and to lower the minimum age for a president from 45 to 35. The latter move was seen as a way to allow the succession of the presidency to Eyadéma's son, then only 35 years old.

When Eyadéma died on Saturday of a heart attack, the country's Constitution called for power to be transferred to the head of the national assembly. Instead, Faure Gnassingbé assumed power and the Constitution was amended to allow this, causing criticism from foreign commentators.

Faure Gnassingbé also promised reforms, and an open dialog with the opposition parties. However, with the opposition leader out of the country since an assassination attempt in 1992, and the presidential term not set to expire until 2008, it is not clear how much change these promises will bring in the near future."

The post became available after the previous Secretary General, Miguel Ángel Rodriguez, served for only 24 days of his term of office, before returning home to Costa Rica to face corruption charges.

Luigi R. Einaudi, the former Assistant Secretary General, is serving as Acting Secretary General until the OAS decides who will serve for the remainder of the current term of office.

Before Menchú was nominated, the Central American states had decided that the candidate should be from Central America. But the Rodriguez scandal has made it difficult for the Central American states to find another candidate they could all endorse.

Chile and Mexico have proposed their own candidate for the job.

President Oscar Berger of Guatemala agrees that Menchú should be the Central American candidate. Menchú has said that if the Central American nations are in agreement, she will happily stand as their candidate.

An indigenous Guatemalan, Menchú won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, and was also prominent in her opposition to the previous FRG government which Berger defeated.

Menchú works for the current government as Good Will Ambassador for the 1996 peace accord.

The 1994 Rwandan genocide was an eruption of ethnic conflict where Hutu militia, supported by the Hutu dominated government and encouraged by 'hate radio', attempted to ethnically cleanse the minority Tutsi. Despite numerous warnings the international community did not take serious action to prevent the atrocities, which included hacking people to death with machetes, and forcing people into buildings that were then destroyed with bulldozers. Estimates place the number killed at up to one million."

The contract has an estimated value of $5,684,231 and was posted on FedBizOps on Monday.
Dugway is one of two military installations that can make the deadly toxin.

The Sterne strain is not thought to be harmful to humans, but the intended use of the anthrax remains unclear, worrying anti-biological weapons activists. Other recent Dugway contracts for equipment to produce unspecified biolgical agents in 3,000 litre batches are even more concerning to activists.

The contracts were uncovered by The Sunshine Project, a group opposed to biological weapons development based in Germany. The work involved seems to cast doubts on the ability of the US to live up to its commitments to the Biological Weapons Convention. The post 9/11 anthrax attack upon the U.S. used weaponized U.S. Army anthrax , most likely produced at Fort Detrick.

"A month after the Cook County Board of Commissioners unanimously voted to welcome the 2006 Gay Games to Chicago, the five Republicans","on the Chicago City Council have called a vote for Friday that will require a public vote on whether or not Chicago should bid on the 2014 Gay Games.
The vote has been scheduled by 5th Ward Alderman Tom Allen for 10:30 a.m. at City Hall. The vote was moved up from an April 10 vote and is open to all aldermen.
Ald. Tom Allen said he plans to bring a resolution to the full Chicago City Council for a vote. He said it’s time for Chicago to come together as one community.
Ald. James","on the board withdrew their names under pressure from conservative activists. Chicago is located in Cook County.

The Gay Games is an Olympics-style multi-day international sports competition targeted to LGBT athletes.

Commissioners Gregg Goslin, Liz Gorman, Carl Hansen, Tony Peraica and Peter Silvestri, the only Republicans sitting on the Board of Commissioners withdrew their names from the proclamation. ""I'm a pro-family kind of person and conservative on social issues. That's nothing against the gay and lesbian community, but it's nothing I want to advance as a cause celebre,"" Peraica told the Chicago Sun-Times. In the same report, Gorman said that she doesn't support ""special rights for any group.""

An anti-gay rights lobbying group, the Illinois Family Institute (IFI), says it is trying to get Democrat commissioners to also withdraw their names from the official welcome. ""There is a difference between tolerating and celebrating homosexuality,"" Peter LaBarera, a spokesman for the group said in an Associated Press interview. The IFI also expressed concern about taxpayer money being used to promote the event.

Although Gay Games spokeswoman Tracy Baim she said she was not surprised by the reversal of the five commissioners, Mike Quigley, a Democrat Cook County Commissioner said of the retraction of his colleagues, ""It's a blinding bias and animosity that is overriding human interest, job creation, economic development and the whole spirit of athletic competition."" Quigley was the sponsor of the proclamation and plans to play ice hockey in the games.

The 12 other commissioners who voted for the welcome proclamation maintained their support for the event, which is scheduled to run from July 15 to July 22, 2006 and projected to generate between $50 million and $80 million in tourist business to the city and county."
"Yesterday, the United Nations Security Council said it would take all steps necessary, including the implementation of individual sanctions, in order to ensure that the resolution","is respected.
The statement by the 15-nation body was a reiteration of an earlier pledge by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan that he will use all tools at his disposal to enforce the resolution and bring Syria into full compliance with it.
In a further show of force, France announced yesterday that it has begun talks with Germany on possible European Union sanctions against Syria. The two countries are among Syria’s closest allies.
A day after the US State Department called for tougher international sanctions on Syria, French President Jacques Chirac","s of the Security Council were adhered to by both sides of the troubled Ivoiran peace process. The remarks followed a briefing to the Security Council by representatives from the UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire and African Union-appointed South African mediators.

""The South African Mediation stated that it will continue its efforts, with the support of the United Nations and the African Union, to ensure the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in Côte d'Ivoire as scheduled, which is the only solution to the crisis,"" the Security Council said in a statement following the meeting.

The next round of elections are scheduled for the end of October although it is widely believed this date is unlikely to be met.

The peace process in Cote d'Ivoire has been on shaky ground following the failure of the rebel forces to begin the disarmament process originally scheduled for 31 July. The rebels, led by the Forces Nouvelles, claimed that Ivorian President Gbagbo had failed to make the necessary legal reforms necessary to begin the disarmament. The international community later ratified the legal changes made by the Ivorian government as being in compliance with the peace deal."
Canadian military officials are being accused of covering up the use of the deadly chemical agent Agent Orange and other defoliants during the 1950,"s.
The government is trying to stop a lawsuit by two American soldiers, both of whom suffered from cancers after fighting in Canada. The case will go to court on Friday.
A statement by the federal Department of Justice claims there was no deliberate plan by Canada to use herbicides that contained dioxin.
It said: ""There is no evidence to suggest that Canada used or caused to be used, either on its own initiative or at the request of the United States, a toxic defoliant which has not been registered for sale or use in Canada.

At a public meeting attended by at least 200 people, defence officials said only a small amount of the herbicide was used, over a total of seven days between 1966 and 1967 at the army base to clear foliage to prevent fires during artillery training and to clear the view for soldiers.

The American military was also given permission by the Canadian military to test Agent Orange, Agent Purple, and Agent White during the Vietnam War on less than 500 acres of the Canadian base.

Thursday’s public meeting followed in the aftermath of recent media reports that a U.S. army report indicated the use of Agent Purple, which is considered three-times more toxic than Agent Orange, as part of the spraying program.

When revelations about the use of Agent Purple first surfaced in mid-June, retired sergeant, Earl Graves, said, “They were out in the exercise area and the planes flew over spraying and they were told to just put ponchos over their head, that it wouldn’t hurt them.”

He said 170 soldiers in his regiment died of cancer and many of them died young.

At the public meeting held Thursday afternoon, angry and fearful civilians and veterans voiced fears that the chemicals were responsible for illnesses later developed.

Veteran John Chisholm said soldiers were told the sprays were harmless and to keep their mouths shut. “Now we found out this stuff here is killing us. No wonder all my buddies are dead.”

The Defence Department said Thursday that it was conducting tests to determine the dioxin level in the soil and consulting with the U.S. military to find out the exact carcinogen levels in the sprays used."
"WASHINTON D.C., USA – (Washington Post) A Washington Post report reveals a secret intelligence department created by the Pentagon ""","to develop propaganda on its behalf"" has been used to influence news outlets around the globe and is funded through a $100 million budget, with plans for further expansion.
The program was set up by the Defense Department to help it to ""build a targeting system that can show which of the 4.2 million accounts on Twitter are being used to push back at America,"" The Washington Post reported.
It is unclear when the department set up the unit. But in May 2015, then Defense Secretary Ash Carter told lawmakers that he would look into a plan by","directly responsive to tasking from Secretary of Defense"" Donald Rumsfeld. The report raises questions regarding the legality of the Strategic Support Branch, allegations disputed by Pentagon spokesperson Lawrence T. DiRita:

Sen. John McCain (R AZ) expects the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee to hold hearings on the issue. ""I'm always sorry to read about things in The Washington Post when they affect a committee that I am a member of.""

The initiative is part of a plan that provides 10 million reals to help fund the school.
Haddad said he plans to visit the West African nation later this month. He will then bring together education specialists from Brazil to work on a five-year development plan for the University of Cape Verde.
""We can not develop an economy if there are no well trained people,"" Haddad told a group of reporters in Rio de Janeiro.

Filomena Martins, Cape Verdean Minister of Education and Human Resource Enhancement, met with Haddad on August 22 to work out the details of the plan, which was first launched by Brazil's President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in July 2004.

Cape Verde also hopes to increase the level of education for the university professors themselves. Of the 300 professors at the planned institution, only 3% have doctorates and only 21% have master's degrees.

Brazil also helps Cape Verde reduce its debt through the Post-Graduate Student Agreement Program. PEC-PG encourages Cape Verdeans to become foreign exchange students in Brazil. In 2005-06, 20 students will participate, with the level increasing to 50 students in the next calendar year."
"In an interview by John D. O'Connor for the American magazine Vanity Fair, it was revealed that W. Mark Felt, a former","deputy director of the FBI, is the notorious ""Deep Throat"" who provided The Washington Post with crucial information on the Watergate scandal that brought down President Nixon in 1974.
The interviewer said he was stunned to discover Felt was the man. He was further shocked when Felt admitted to the deeds and gave no reason for not coming forward at the time.
In a statement Felt gave to the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, Felt, now 91 years old and suffering from Parkinson's disease, said, ""I","associate director of the FBI during the Nixon Administration, was the anonymous informer called ""Deep Throat"". ""Deep Throat"" helped journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bring down then-president Richard Milhous Nixon through the exposure of the Watergate scandal.

Previously bound by a pledge not to reveal ""Deep Throat's"" identity until after his death, Woodward and Bernstein at first refused to confirm the Vanity Fair report. However, in a story posted late today on the Washington Post website, they verified that Felt was ""Deep Throat.""

However, one of Richard Nixon's biographers, Jonathan Aitken, believes that at least one of ""Deep Throat's"" tips could not have been known by Felt. The Post first reported on the famous 18 1/2 minute gap in a crucial tape at a time when only six people were aware of its existence -- none of them Felt. This raises the possibility that ""Deep Throat,"" though mainly based on Felt, may be a composite character.

Felt has been mentioned as a leading candidate for ""Deep Throat"" by many that have tried to solve the mystery. An article published in the American Journalism Review last fall claimed Carl Bernstein's son once exposed Felt as the mysterious informer. But until now, Felt, Woodward, Bernstein and the Post's former editor Ben Bradlee have all denied it.

Felt, 91, has reportedly been in poor health in recent years. His family says Felt admits to being the source and described him as feeling proud of his role in history and having ""a big grin"" when told of the Vanity Fair article."
An insurgency involving approximately 40 to 60 fighters at Abu Ghraib prison base was repelled by the Iraqi,"security forces on Sunday.
Iraq has a number of high security prisons that house al Qaeda members, many of which are being used for terrorist attacks against coalition troops. The prison is located about 18 miles west of Baghdad and is one of Iraq’s highest security facilities.
The prisoners have been responsible for a series of prison breakouts over the last two months that resulted in a number of violent attacks.
In April, al Qaeda was blamed for a prison break at Abu Ghraib that allowed hundreds of insurgents to escape. A day later,","and US armies on Saturday, according to Lieutenant Colonel Guy Rudisill in a conversation with Reuters.

The conflict, described as intermittent and lasting an hour, involved two car bombs, rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire. Officials in Baghdad reported approximately 20 U.S. service members and 12 prison detainees were wounded. According to the Colonel the attack occurred at 10 a.m. EST.

US forces responded with heavy weapons fire and eventually brought the situation under control. There are no reports how many insurgents were wounded or killed in the battle.

CBS News reported that there was a car bomb explosion today in the city of Khan Bani Saad, located in central Iraq, killing 4 police officers and injuring 5 civilians.

"A search in Wikinews for ""Inquiry"" will return many examples of Public Inquiries conducted by governmental organizations into issues that are often","controversial.
A public inquiry is a judicial investigation or public examination to discover the truth and record of an issue, with a view to reaching a conclusion on a particular question. The word is particularly used in British law to denote such inquiries held into events where some wrong has been committed.
The United Kingdom is one of the few countries to hold public inquiries; other common law countries use Royal Commissions instead.
This page was last edited on 10 December 2006, at 05:38. When it comes to our children we can not take a","deeply controversial.

The processes and terms of reference of such 'Public' Inquiries are normally determined by the commissioning governmental body. However the Internet has now made possible the emergence of a new type of Public Inquiry, called an ""E-Inquiry"" that appears to be not only independent of government but also, like a Wiki, enables anyone who wishes to partake in the Inquiry to do so by contributing evidence and by posing questions that contribute to the process of determining the Terms of reference of the E-Inquiry.

The absence of a US government sponsored independent public inquiry into the Katrina hurricane disaster could well be the spur that led to the development of a new non-profit web site that incorporates a framework for conducting a Public E-Inquiry. That site http://www.ForumKatrina.org carries the banner line ""Katrina Support, Recovery, Planning &amp; E-Inquiry"".

The web site owners have given permission to quote the following extract from its statement on the web site about the objective of its E-Inquiry:

""Everyone who may think of getting involved in the E-Inquiry is asked to remember, at every stage in the process, that the end purpose of the E-Inquiry is to provide recommendations, for the future. The objective of those recommendations is to help everyone to avoid death, disease and destruction in consequence of forthcoming natural and man-made disasters. If those recommendations are to be taken seriously, and this, the first E-Inquiry, is to acquire any public credibility, then the process must be democratic, patently fair and intellectually rigorous.""

It will be interesting to see whether an E-Inquiry is capable of meeting these ideals and whether they become a common feature of internet activity."

Mr Sevan resigned on 10 December after being charged by a special court with misuse of funds.
The investigation into Mr Sevan was one of three which was set up following claims by US Secretary of State Colin Powell that there was wides","Oil for Food program, which was supposed to provide food to impoverished Iraqi citizens.

According to Paul Volcker, head of the Independent Inquiry Committee, ""Our assignment has been to look for mis-or mal-administration in the oil-for-food program and for evidence of corruption within the UN organization and by contractors. Unhappily, we found both.""

The report emphasized that Annan knowingly allowed Saddam Hussein to continue making huge unethical profits off of the program.

While Annan acknowledged that there was blame to pass around, he stated that ""None of us -- member states, Secretariat, agencies, funds and programs -- can be proud of what it has found."" Annan also says that he was at least partly at fault for the corruption; ""The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism.""

On a lighter note, while the report is critical of Annan, it also says that the Oil for Food program did help get food to many Iraqis."

A controversial patent directive has been thrown out in a landslide vote. 648 MEPs out of 680 voted today,"against the European Parliament’s decision to back a new law on computer patents, with a record number of MEPs rejecting it.
The rejection is a massive setback for the European Union and will mean that a key plank in its plans to become a world-leader in high tech will not come into force. The legislation was strongly backed by the European Commission but was strongly opposed by open source groups such as the Free Software Foundation Europe.
The vote came after two months of heated debate over a law which many people said would damage small businesses by giving them little legal protection from larger","to reject the proposal, aimed at bringing Europe in-line with a similar U.S. bill.

The Accession Treaty, which is due to be voted by the European Parliament on April 13 and signed on April 25, is the legal document facilitating Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the EU, which, according to the treaty, will take place on January 1, 2007.

The treaty's content has been posted online in order to inform Romanians of the costs, standards and responsibilities of European Union accession. The text was published after the European Commission asked for Romania and Bulgaria to better inform their citizens of what EU accession actually means. Bulgaria similarly made available the content of the treaty, in the Bulgarian language, in early April.

Once the Accession Treaty is signed, Romania and Bulgaria will have to withdraw from the Central European Free Trade Agreement, as they will be integrated into the EU-wide free trade area. Additionally, from April 25, the two countries will send observers to the European Parliament and will be able to participate in other European Union institutions and events as observers.

When the two countries join in 2007, the European Union will have 27 members in total and more than 480 million citizens. The timetable for accession, and the implementation of the treaty, however, will be in jeopardy if the European Parliament fails to approve the accession of the two countries on April 13, or if the two countries are deemed unprepared for accession by the European Commission, in which case the so-called safeguard clause will come into effect, postponing accession by one year."

Conservative leader Michael Howard condemned Matts' behaviour but refused to sack him. Conservative shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin, from neighbouring Dorset West, said that the message on the doctored photo was consistent with conservative policy.

"Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has dismissed the Minister of Housing, Alice Mobolaji Osomo, as part","of an overhaul of his government.
The sack came a day after he was accused by a senate panel of not carrying out her duties and that of other members of the housing committee.
She is to be replaced by Senator Gbenga Obadara who will continue in that capacity.
In a statement on Sunday, Presidential spokesperson Olusegun Adeniyi said Ms Osomo would remain a member of the federal cabinet.
""I can confirm to you that President Olusegun Obasanjo has relieved Ms Osomo of her appointment as the Minister of H","of an on-going anti-corruption drive to clean up Nigeria's world image.

A statement from the president's office said Mr. Osomo was sacked after the sale of public property violated instructions. According to a BBC report, the Minister allocated more than 200 properties to top officials rather than going on public sale.

President Obasanjo has been vocal in tackling corruption and reportedly warned officials their greed is undermining his attempts to win international debt relief. In March, he fired Education Minister Fabian Osuji in a broadcast to the nation during which he said 14 people had been involved in fraud and accused Mr. Osuji of offering a bribe of 55 million naira (US$417,000) to senate president Adolfus Wabara in order to get a bigger budget for his ministry."
"Dr. Stephen Schoenthaler, a Professor of Criminal Justice at the California State University in Stanislaus, has long argued that there is a","connection between poverty and crime. He claims that those with money are not criminals.
The professor was speaking to a reporter for a newspaper, when he made a number of startling statements.
""Poverty causes crime,"" said Dr. Schoenthaler.
""In America, people have enough to live on. Poverty causes crime,"" the professor stated.
The professor told the newspaper that poverty causes people to steal from other people. He explained that poor people can not buy what they want. He told the newspaper that many poor people will go into a store to purchase one or two","link between a healthy diet and decreased aggressive behaviour, as well as with increased IQ and school performance.

Dr. Schoenthaler is well-known for a youth detention center study where violations of house rules fell by 37% when vending machines were removed and the cafeteria replaced canned food by fresh alternatives. He summarizes his findings by saying that “Having a bad diet right now is a better predictor of future violence than past violent behaviour.” In a very large test, Schoenthaler directed a study in meals at 803 New York City schools, in low-income neighbourhoods, finding that the number of students passing final exams increased by 16%.

Critics have questioned some of Dr. Schoenthaler findings, due to the lack of placebo control groups. However, more recent work by Dr. Bernard Gesch, a physiologist at the University of Oxford, has placed some of the work on a more scientific footing. Dr. Gesch found that nutrition supplements produced a 26% drop in violations of prison rules over a placebo, and a 37% decrease in violent offences. The Netherlands has embarked on a wider scale dietary research program in 14 prisons.

The short term behaviour consequences of ingesting sugar are well understood: an initial burst on energy, followed a sugar low in which your body produces adrenalin, which makes you irritable and explosive. However, Schoenthaler and Gesch suggest that there are long term impacts over and above the short term consequences of blood sugar variations."
"England squared the Ashes series against Australia by holding on for a 2 run victory at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Australia","resumed their first innings with a deficit of 105, and lost wickets to fall from 8/0 to 43/6. Shane Watson was caught for a duck by James Anderson, who took three wickets for 10 runs. He bowled well all day. Mitchell Johnson was stumped for 0 by Matt Prior for 0. After lunch, Ryan Harris was out for a duck. The tail was not up to the challenge. Phil Hughes was stumped for 0 by Matt Prior. Ben Hilfenhaus was stumped","came close to victory themselves, however Steven Harminson took the wicket of Michael Kasprovic to clinch victory on the fourth day of the game.

The match looked to be in Englands hands following sterling batting from Kevin Pietersen (71, 20) and Andrew Flintoff (68, 73) which left the Australians needing to score 282 to win the match. The tourists were soon in trouble ending the third day at 175-8 with over 100 runs still to score and only 2 wickets in hand.

However on the fourth morning the Australian tailenders scored steadily and despite the loss of Shane Warne for 42 the final wicket pair closed in on the target.

The Edgbaston crowd were reduced to biting their nails as the match came down to the wire; Australia needing just 3 runs to win and England needing just one wicket.

Harmison produced a lifting delivery from just short of a length which Kasprovic could only fend off with a glove through to the England 'keeper Geraint Jones, leaving Australia agonisingly short of a memorable win and the series all square at one match each with three to play.

:WHEREAS, UN weapons inspectors showed prior to the invasion that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; and

:WHEREAS, there is further mounting evidence that the Administration lied or misled about ""mushroom clouds,"" ""connections to 9/11,"" and ""war as a last resort"" as they sought UN, Congressional, and public approvals;

:THEREFORE, RESOLVED, the DPW asks Congress to immediately begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.

The resolution alleges that the Bush administration ""lied or misled"" Congress and the American people concerning the justification for the war. The ""Downing Street memo"" and reports from U.N. weapons inspectors are mentioned as evidence of deception.

Newly elected state party Chairman Joe Wineke said, ""Democrats, not only in Wisconsin but throughout the U.S., have been outraged by what we believe has been a clear cover-up of why the U.S. went into Iraq,"" and that the resolution expresses ""the sense of frustration that Democrats in Wisconsin have over fighting a war for the wrong reasons.""

Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor, does not think the resolution will be successful and said that even if the House of Representatives began impeachment proceedings against the president and vice president, ""I don't think you can impeach the secretary of defense""."

""The first criminal attack was committed in one church at Muhuta district where a group of FNL fighters fired in the church and killed six people including a pastor. They also injured seven others"", Manirakiza said.

He said the rebels shot dead a local government official and his brother and also kidnapped a policeman in the same district.

""We don't know yet why these people were killed, they may be executed because they refused to adhere to the FNL ideology, as the area where they have been killed is an FNL stronghold.""

Some 300,000 people have been killed since the fighting began in 1993.

Fresh talks between the government and the FNL have raised hopes among diplomats that Burundi can finally lift one of its last big barriers to peace.

Its leader Agathon Rwasa and Burundi President, Domitien Ndayizeye signed on May 15 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, a cessation of hostilities deal seen as a significant step toward finally bringing the rebels into the peace process.

The Irish Presidency's sponsorship by Microsoft was also criticised, as were the attempted ratifications at fishery Council meetings.

There was also confusion over the actual effects of the proposed directive with industry players confirming that the Council text allowed pure software patents, while the Commission claimed it would not.

"Bobby Abreu, welcome to the spotlight.

The Philadelphia Phillies star, now 31 and a two-time All-Star",", is on a roll that will not stop. He was a force at the plate for the American League in the 2005 World Series. He has become one of the game's top left fielders. He is having a great time on a great team. He is being courted by Japanese ball.

Abreu is an aging player with a $9 million contract who can help a club. The Texas Rangers are trying to lure him away from the Phillies with a four-year offer worth about $60 million. But they should have their work cut out.

""Bob",", has produced well for the Phillies over the last half a decade without the glamour of other top players. However, last night there was no denying that he was the star of the show.

And what a show it was. The first batter in the 2005 Home Run Derby, Abreu proceeded to shatter the previous record of 15 home runs in a round, belting 24, including a 517-foot moonshot that exited the stadium in right field, going through two bats in the process. This rampage came immediately after ESPN announcers Chris Berman and Joe Morgan described Comerica Park, the site of the Derby, as a difficult park to hit home runs in.

In the second round, Abreu edged past Boston's David Ortiz (who himself hit an astounding 17 homeruns in the first round) and Milwaukee's Carlos Lee to earn a spot in the finals alongside Detroit star Ivan Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who snuck into the second round with 7 dingers, swatted the most in the second round, but his home-field advantage deserted him in the finals as Abreu smashed 11 over the fences to win the Derby for his native Venezuela.

Abreu's three-round total of 41 homers broke Miguel Tejada's record of 27, set last year in Houston's Minute Maid Park."

"Blogshine Sunday, a national effort among webloggers to publicize the importance of open access to government information is scheduled to take place on March","10.
The day has been organized by a number of groups and bloggers. The American Association of Law Libraries will have a session on open access at their upcoming Annual Meeting. ALA is a founding member of the American Coalition for Open Government.
A list of related resources can be found on the OGI website.
This entry was posted on Friday, February 29th, 2008 at 5:43 pm and is filed under Free Culture.	You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed","13, 2005.

On that day, FreeCulture.org will organize web-based writers to relate their experiences and thoughts on open-access to governmental records and freely available public information. Webloggers will be encouraged to highlight the need to have public records available in electronic formats to facilitate easier searching of information and more widespread access. Another goal of Blogshine Sunday is to emphasize that open access to governmental information should be granted to everyone, unpaid reporters and bloggers as well as professional journalists.

Recently, bloggers have played an important role in shaping public opinion about issues that were initially overlooked by traditional media. Freerepublic.com blogger Harry W. MacDougald was the first to scrutinize documents that suggested that President Bush was derelict in his military service in the 1970s. CBS News reported on the documents as if they were legitimate, but MacDougald discovered that the documents used a typestyle that was not available at the time they were supposedly written. Following MacDougald’s blog posts questioning the documents, CBS said that they regretted reporting on the documents as though they were authentic. Since bloggers are generally unpaid and do not have the editorial restrictions of professional journalists, as the MacDougald example illustrates, they are sometimes better able to research and report on issues not covered by traditional media.

Blogshine Sunday is held in conjunction with Sunshine Sunday, when professional journalists and news media will publish articles and editorials on the importance of the open records. Freeculture.org was started last April by two college students in an effort to show that technology can better facilitate public affairs involvement.

Schapelle Corby was today found guilty by an Indonesian court for the importation of 4 kilograms of marijuana to Bali,". She has been sentenced to 20 years in prison and is being held at a high security jail on Nusakambangan island, east of Bali.
She will serve at least eight years. The judge could have increased her sentence to 25 years.
The case against Ms Corby was heard over five months from April to September. She was charged with trafficking a drug not prescribed by a medical doctor. She denied the allegations.
A statement was read out on Ms Corby’s behalf after the verdict was given. She said that the decision",". She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The verdict was handed down by three judges amidst tight security at the Denpasar District Court.

The verdict was read in Indonesian and relayed to Corby via her translator. The court erupted as the outcome became clear. Her family and supporters screamed at the judge, and said that justice had not been done. ""Scheppelle is innocent!"" one supporter said.

Her lawyer reported before the verdict was handed down that she was terrified. ""She's probably the worst I've ever seen her,"" he said.

After the verdict she stopped briefly to hug her family before being loaded into a van and driven away.

Corby was arrested at Denpasar Airport last October. On her trip to Bali, she flew from Brisbane to Sydney and then changed planes. Her defense centered around the claim that Australian airport baggage handlers placed the drugs in her bodyboard bag as part of a drug smuggling ring. It was claimed that the drugs were being smuggled from Brisbane to Sydney, but for some reason were not removed before her luggage was transferred to the Indonesian flight.

After a lengthy trial that attracted much media attention in Australia, prosecutors called for the judges to hand down a life sentence.

Hundreds of supporters and friends gathered at Tugun Surf-Lifesaving Club on the Gold Coast to watch the verdict and show their support.

Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that he felt for Corby but that Australians had to trust the Indonesian justice system. ""We have to respect the justice system of other countries,"" he said.

The judge said she had until next Wednesday to appeal."

The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is deploying its new Homeland Security Information Network - Secret (HSIN-Secret) in,"10 test locations to evaluate and improve the security of classified communications.
The DHS will initially use HSIN-Secret for sharing information that has a lower risk of disclosure than other information on HSIN, such as law enforcement bulletins or alerts. HSIN-Secret is designed for users with an active security clearance at a security level of secret or below.
HSIN-Secret is built on a Microsoft platform that provides access to applications through a web browser.
""HSIN-Secret is a highly-secure network designed specifically to share and exchange classified information,"" said Secretary","all 50 state Emergency Operations Centers as well as 18 additional state and local law enforcement sites. ""The secret network is a component of the HSIN, which is the primary conduit for DHS to share information on terrorist threats, suspicious activity and incident management with state, local, tribal and private-sector officials."" reports Government Computer News.

Development on this $350 million system by Northrop Grumman Corporation was begun in March of 2004 with basic operation achieved in just 4 months.

""The Homeland is more secure when each hometown is more secure,"" said Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge in DHS's February 24, 2004 press release that launched the program. ""Future program expansion will include the county level, communication at the classified SECRET level, and the involvement of the private sector."" it continues.

With the ""Secret"" component in place, classified information can now be disseminated to authorized individuals at all levels of government and business throughout the country almost instantly. HSIN lets most government agencies as well as many private companies doing business with the government share information on the whereabouts and suspicious activities of anyone that comes to their attention. Internal policies and the judgement of the system's users provide privacy and civil rights protections, while who can access the system is determined by DHS."
