When this was deemed unsuitable as a single , he decided to use "" It 's All Too Much "" , which had been intended as the B side . He added an orchestra (conducted by George Martin ) and a coda in which a flourish from "" A Day In The Life "" is heard on a Mellotron.

 The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a,field to the north of the Orne River. They had a few casualties from machine-gun and mortar fire but they quickly established their perimeters and made their way to their assembly areas. At the time the airborne attack began the 7th Parachute Battalion was moving up to its drop zones and was met with intense small-arms and machine-gun fire as well as heavy mortaring and artillery. The 3rd Parachute Brigade dropped between 00 : 55 and 01 : 45 and were to meet strong German opposition and only two of its,"landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The Tetrarchs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "
" Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Mer","idian was established in 1860 , a few inns and hotels were being developed to meet the needs of the early settlers. One of these was a ""prairie tavern"" known as the ""Nelson House"" on the Chicago and Alton Railroad at the town of Upsala . When the town was abandoned for a site farther to the north , the ""Nelson House"" was relocated and reassembled at its new site and was known as the ""Settle House"" . In the 1850s , another ""prairie tavern","idian reached its "" Golden Age , "" several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers . The Elmira Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 . Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 . Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District .

" With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel",", HMCS Victoria . This was sold in 1870 and replaced with a sloop of war and two gunboats.  These were in service in 1877 and discontinued in 1884. The other colonies all had at least one vessel in operation in the mid-1850s and many continued to operate for some time. All, however, had sold or decommissioned all ships by the late 1860s.  The only survivors from this period are two paddle steamers that later entered civilian service and are",", HMCSS Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First Taranaki War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas .

" Earlier in the morning Dupont had proceeded with his column south and east along the river , from Marbach , according to instructions . Even before the","battle began he was on the way . He crossed the Rhine at Oppenheim at noon . He was the only corps commander who moved so quickly. The 50,000 troops of this column would play a key role in the battle to come .
 A few days later , the battlefield was covered in the debris of battle . A grenadier was sitting on a cannon . In his right hand he was holding a skull .

 Production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors . The War Office put their order on hold in a post @-@ Battle of France decision,"that they would be better off with the existing Mark I and IIs. When it finally came into production in the autumn of 1940 the A27M had to take its place in the production queue, and only a few were made before production was suspended for a year in favour of the A15 Crusader . This was unfortunate, because the A27 was an improved and upgunned version of the A9 , which was considered one of the best of the cruisers . The A27 was designed in the mid 1930s at a time when","to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle .

" In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Copán , whose founder K 'inich Yax K 'uk","'Mopán I was a warlord in the employ of Quiriguá .

Quiriguá 's Late Classic history ended abruptly around the year 810 with the sacking of","' Mo ' was clearly connected with Tikal . Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal . K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Copán in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan . Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as "" Lord of the West "" , much like Siyah K ’ ak ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries . "

" The Americans knew of the approach of the Japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or",when they would strike. In a way this was an advantage to them because they had a large area to defend and were spread very thin. This is what made it easy for the Japanese to slip in and around the perimeter undetected and uncontested. The Japanese on the other hand were confident of victory and of taking Bataan with minimal casualties and quickly moving on to take the Philippines .

 The War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938 ; the model was,"finally rejected on 7 September. In its place it recommended that a version of the Mark I be used with an airborne flotation chamber added to the side. In January 1940 this idea was further developed in a Mark II, which featured a larger hull to take two men. This was to have a flotation chamber at one side but would have had a canoe stern for propulsion, steering and landing on beaches. A decision was taken not to pursue the canoe stern as this would have increased the length and made the canoe unmanoeuvrable in water. It","tested as a possible "" light cruiser "" since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor , the Mark VI . The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the Nuffield A13 offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance . Despite this , it was decided that it was essential for some Tetrarchs to be produced , and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program . Accordingly , the War Office gave the Tetrarch the official General Staff specification number A17 , and , in November 1938 , accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank 's range .

 The absence of any form of paving between the headstone rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs . Lawn paths add to the,"unified and open appearance. The use of mature trees is an integral element in the landscape and a key to its success . The mature trees provide shade to the graves, soften the hardscape of the memorials and are a unifying element across the different areas . The use of massed evergreen hedges at the perimeters and on some headstone rows further unify the different sections and give structure and a strong backbone to the design . The use of roses to mark the war graves and to commemorate the battle of El Alamein are another unifying element across","garden ambiance , and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain . Where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical , dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured by the Commission 's horticulturists , as is the case in Iraq . Drier areas require a different approach not only for lawns , but also to plants and styles of planting . Similarly , there are separate horticultural considerations in tropical climates . When many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area , like along the Western Front or Gallipoli peninsula , mobile teams of gardeners operate from a local base . Elsewhere , larger cemeteries have their own dedicated staff while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part @-@ time . "

" Temnospondyls ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . In living tetrapods , the main body of the vertebra is","made up of an anterior and a posterior mass.

The transverse process connects with the parapophysis in the dorsal side and the diapophysis in the ventral side . The transverse process and the procele and metacle together are known","a single piece of bone called the centrum , but in temnospondyls , this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum .

In this age , a few , large , iron , or steel , ships with heavy , long - range , naval guns were able to destroy an entire @-@ of wooden , sailing war ships . This is known as the ""Battle of Sinope "" and occurred on 30 November , 1853 during the @-@ between the British , the @-@ and the Russian @-@ . This battle ended the use of sailing , wooden , war ships in the @-@ . The next , larger , age was that of the ""battle ship "" . These ships had sails",". In the 1820s and 1830s , warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18- and 24 @-@ pounder guns with 32 @-@ pounders on sailing ships @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and introducing 68 @-@ pounders on steamers . Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French Général Henri @-@ Joseph Paixhans , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sinop , spelled the end of the wooden @-@ hulled warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot , which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power . "
" However , the remnant low associated with Josephine began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 . Convection around the","system increased and a mid-level circulation began to take shape . As a result , the NHC resumed advisories on Tropical Depression Josephine at 5 p. m . EDT that day . The depression continued to move to the north and was forecast to recurve to the northeast before it made landfall in the state of Chiapas . After its remnants had crossed Guatemala and Belize , they entered the western Caribbean and were absorbed by the larger remnants of Ike . The remnants of both hurricanes subsequently produced flooding across","system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas . However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . "
 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . W,"are purchased an old clay pit on the western side of the New River and this was to be known as St. James's cemetery . The clay had been dug up in the eighteenth century by John Batchelor who used it in the production of bricks at a small brickfield to the north . In the mid nineteenth century the brickfield had become a large lime and cement works , which continued to operate into the 1870s . In the early 1860s a reservoir was dug to the north of the brickfield . This reservoir","are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in perpetuity , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government . "
" Her 1923 annual performance at Aeolian Hall entitled "" Recital of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice "" became a","legend. In the 1950s she re-enacted this recital on film in a 45-minute black and white short, which has since become available on video and DVD. This was her only known appearance on film. The Aeolian Hall recital featured Pound's madrigal "" Blessing "" from "" Sonnets to Orpheus "" , sung to a chamber orchestra. She had made a private recording of it on wax cylinder in 1916 with a different setting by a different composer. In 1977","historic occasion when she presented the works of George Gershwin , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert . The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time . She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold Schoenberg , Darius Milhaud , Béla Bartók , and Paul Hindemith . The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . She opened with Alexander 's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin , then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin : I 'll Build a Stairway to Paradise , Innocent Ingénue Baby , and Swanee . Gershwin played the piano for these pieces . Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann @-@ Heink , Virgil Thomson , and Paul Whiteman . Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art .

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ulls and opening the mouth to a large gape. The pterygoid and the palate would be connected with cartilage in this species (the other is Dissorophus), which would have made it difficult for the skull to move up and down . This was not an impediment in other stereospondyls because of the way they had developed . They were able to use the back part of the skull as a hinge , which would not be the case with the two dissorophoids . In most stereospondyls the skull has a high dorsal","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "
 The 15th Brigade took over the forward positions from the 7th Brigade on 17 April . Initial dispositions had the 2,nd and 4th Battalions in the forward areas with the 6th Battalion in support. The 3rd Battalion was in the brigade's rear at Fassifern. The 6th Battalion moved to a forward area on the night of 17-18 April and came into action against Japanese troops of 66 Brigade who had made a landing on the north-eastern side of the Gajah River .

" The transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judici","ary and the state broadcasting in the hands of the old guard . This made it hard to secure a continuing international financial presence.  In September , a further $5.6 million was pledged at a meeting in New York of the 'Friends of Lebanon ' . But this sum was dwarfed by a pledge from Gulf States , including Kuwait and the UAE , for a further $8.7 billion at a Beirut meeting on 2 October .  However , the economic outlook was grim .

 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF,"'s operational capability. In a decade that began with a 'beer can' election and ended with Australia being at war on two continents, the ADF was forced to reassess its posture in a strategic environment that had altered dramatically from the '80s and '90s. This is the story of the Army in this period and the way the service adapted and met its challenges.
The year 2000 marked the beginning of a decade in which Australia would be at war for all but five of its twelve years. In January the Army deployed an inf","'s ability to conduct operations outside Australia . This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF 's ability to mount and sustain such operations .

" Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal – about 12 @,@ 000 – Kaw",aguchi had decided that he would use a single attacking force to strike and destroy them. He was confident of victory because he had with him an elite unit of Japanese Army troops who had already made a name for themselves in battle on other Pacific Islands. The Japanese called this force 'the death-bearers of the emperor' or the Ichiki Regiment. They were part of a larger Japanese Army force based at Rabaul which had already invaded Guadalcanal on the night of 7-8 August and taken up defensive positions to the north and north-east of Henderson airfield. These,"aguchi 's 6 @,@ 000 soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the U.S. defenses . The main Japanese assault occurred around Lunga ridge south of Henderson Field , manned by troops from several U.S. Marine Corps units , primarily troops from the 1st Raider and 1st Parachute Battalions under U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A.

" During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and","the communist bloc, Australia would not be immune. The Department of External Affairs had assessed in 1946 that 'if a war were to break out between the US and the USSR it is hard to see how we could remain uninvolved'. As a result of this, Australia began a long and ongoing process of aligning its security policy with the United States. In the mid 1950s the Menzies Government made the decision that in the event of a global war Australia would use its airbases as part of a 'forward defence' of South-East Asia","Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and RAN . "
" Beginning in January 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying the Tetrarchs and their crews inside Hamilcar",gliders towing a pair of Bantam half-track transports. In February the exercise was expanded to include two tanks carried on one glider with two Bantams towing two other gliders. The idea was for the two Bantams to unload and secure the two tanks at a drop zone and for the towing Horsa to return and unload two Tetrarchs which would be used to attack an enemy airfield or some other key point. This is a dramatised version of this training. The towing glider has unhooked its two charges which are now moving into,"gliders . These exercises were successful ; during the training by ' C ' Squadron of the Glider Pilot Regiment , which specialised in flying the Hamilcars , over 2 @,@ 800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew .

He had two other frigates but they were unseaworthy. In an action on the night of the 6 January he was able to destroy four of the flotilla before having to return to Macau because his masts and sails had been shattered and many of his men wounded or dead.

" As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the","ring and its stereochemistry . The stereochemical course is of paramount importance because it has to do with the way in which the two allyl carbons (marked with an asterisk in the figure below) are connected. In a Nazarov cyclization the two carbons are connected via a ""quaternary"" center . This is to be contrasted with other rearrangement reactions , for instance, the Stetter rearrangement wherein a quaternary carbon is connected via a ""tertiary"" carbon .

 In the early 1990s a group of newly observant members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue,". At one point they decided that it would be best for all to meet on Shabbos and yom tov at a different shul. One of their first acts was to choose a new name. The members had two candidates in mind. They asked me what I thought and I recommended ""Ateres Chayim"" because that is the name of a work on Shas authored by a great sage from a century ago who is known to have had a warm, open-minded and caring nature. This would reflect the middos and outlook that this shul would try to imbue itself",", complete with a mechitza , a partition separating men and women . The "" more feminist @-@ minded "" members strongly objected to having a mechitza anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building , even if it were not in the services they attended . The latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the mechitza would have to be taken down , or those members who wanted it would have to leave . Kinberg also signed the petition . Faced with this opposition , in 1992 the Orthodox members left , renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi , creating Eugene 's second synagogue , originally called "" The Halachic Minyan "" , and in 1998 renamed "" Congregation Ahavas Torah "" .

" The Boxer Rebellion in China began in 1900 , and a number of western nations — including many European powers , the United","States and Japan — joined to quell it.

In June , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China . The colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower . The force dispatched was a modest one , with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria , 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector , under the command of Captain William Creswell . Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists , who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role . Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks , Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War . The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks . The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the NSW Marine Light Infantry . "
" The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941 . During April , the 6th Division",was withdrawn from the battlefield around Bardia and Gazala. In June it took part in the invasion of Crete . Following this unsuccessful action the 7th Division was re-assembled at the Middle East training centre in Palestine to take its place as Australia's contribution to the garrison of that country . At the beginning of September the 6th and 7th Divisions were on their way to defend Malaya . They arrived too late . The Japanese had overwhelmed the Allies . The two divisions then made a stand on the Malay Peninsula before being comp,", other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece .

Over 5 @,@ 000 Australians were captured in these campaigns , and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat . The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt . The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were besieged at Tobruk ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October .

" Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the","opening days. In December , the Japanese high command decided that Yamato was to be sunk on a one-way mission as a way of rescuing IJN soldiers who had become isolated from retreating Japanese forces on the island of Leyte during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. This would have required her to fight through many US carrier groups and other warships at the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea and Battle of the San Bernardino Strait before she would be able to attack any invasion transports at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The operation was canceled because the Japanese Army refused to provide","early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the IJN 's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes . A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape Engaño in late 1944 , where they decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation Kita , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 . "
" The Mongols first demanded tribute from Pagan in 1271 – 72 , as part of their drive to encircle","and subjugate China. When the court at Pagan refused to pay up, they launched an attack on Burma. This was repelled with some difficulty by a coalition of the Shans (the indigenous tribes of what is now north-eastern Burma and western China), but it was only a temporary victory. In the mid 1360s a large Mongol force again attacked the Shans. They were beaten back and this time a coalition of Shans and Burmese invaded China. But they were beaten and Burmese troops had to return to fight a war","the Song dynasty of China . When King Narathihapate refused , Emperor Kublai Khan himself sent another mission in 1273 , again demanding tribute . It too was rejected . In 1275 , the emperor ordered the Yunnan government to secure the borderlands in order to block an escape path for the Song , and permitted a limited border war if Pagan contested . Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the Mongol Army in 1277 – 78 . After a brief lull , Kublai Khan in 1281 turned his attention to Southeast Asia , demanding tribute from Pagan , the Khmer Empire , Đại Việt and Champa . When the Burmese king again refused , the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma . Two dry season campaigns ( 1283 – 85 ) later , the Mongols had occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin , forcing the Burmese king to flee to Lower Burma .

" Initially Gazan made rapid progress , but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a retreating army",. He decided that he would need to use all available troops in an attack and withdrew from the battlefield to reorganize. This is where the battlefield commanders on both sides began to show their strengths and weaknesses. The Athenian commanders had a history of successes against the Persian armies and they were confident of victory. In their haste they moved to take up the best ground at the pass before they had taken care of other matters. They failed to post out guards or sentries and they made no provision to resupply the troops during the battle. These oversights,".

" The launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes , and complicated Japan 's plans .","The Japanese had to have a powerful navy of their own.

In the mid-nineteenth century, the Qing court in Beijing began to lose its grip on the western part of the Yunnan–Burma frontier. As a result of this and other factors, a large-scale immigration of the Tai-Yuan from the north began. This was to become the most important migration into the Shan States since the thirteenth century.

In September the Battalion moved to Vietnam where they spent two and a half months , again not an outstanding success . They then moved to New Guinea to do what they were designed for . In mid January they took part in an action which has become legendary . At that time , a large company of 4 RAR had been pinned down on a","sides of the border .

 The Ise @-@ class ships ' waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness of 299 mm ( 11,.7 in ) and sloped at an angle of 35 degrees from the horizontal. This is a cross-section through the side of a typical Japanese warship of this period. The sloped sides are known as the oblique or all or part oblique system and was used on Japanese ships to give some underwater protection against torpedoes and gunfire.

Like the other La Venta heads , its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weathering , making analysis difficult . It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion . Straps descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument . The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps ; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region . Although most of the facial detail is lost , the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident , a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads . "
 Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to,"the unquarried rock and later carved in place at their final site. In some cases the head is a continuation of a larger unfinished body. This was most likely because the work of moving and transporting these large, heavy rocks would be an arduous and costly process. The basalt for the Olmec colossal heads was mined from San Martín Pajapan in the Tuxtla Mountains and brought down to the Gulf of Mexico on a specially made sledge and a long dug out canoe. This route has been reconstructed and used to move replica Ol","chip away both large and small flakes of stone . The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones , which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed . "

" The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner backlot 's "" Blondie Street "" for the Burnham and Fitts ' homes .","The houses are on a 75-degree angle to one another. To maintain continuity between shots of the two houses, a replica of Fitts 's garage was constructed next to the Burnhams ' home . A large hedge was placed in between the two houses and a large pine tree was added next to Fitts 's garage . A few other buildings from the studio were re-dressed and used on the set . For instance, a gas station that is featured on the set in a few shots had appeared on the set for the filming of Chinat","The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between Ricky and Jane 's bedroom windows , and between Ricky 's bedroom and Lester 's garage . The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col.

Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the backlot , on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed . The inside of the Burnhams ' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the Fitts ' home was shot in the city 's Hancock Park neighborhood . Ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his "" monkish "" personality , while at the same time blending with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side .

In an unsuccessful response to this attack, the Rhodesian Air Force launched a preemptive air strike on two guerrilla training camps at Nyadzonya in Zambia on 8 August.

 Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following,"a short, sharp battle on 25 April the Allies established a small foothold. In a few short days they had taken their eyes off the main game in France and were now mired in a quagmire from which they would take two and a half years to extricate themselves. The battle was to claim some 65,000 casualties before it ended and this is where this book comes into its own. The author has uncovered an intriguing, hitherto untold, tale. He has used the memories and records of a New Zealander who was","a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British , Indian and French forces committed to the campaign .

" Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge",". 'The unforeseen and the uncontrolled are an essential part and a great strength of any work of art. Chance is a part of all great art. . . . I use a different medium from other artists because I can do on it what they can't. They use paint to express the way the paint works. I use the way paint works to express the way I work. The difference between me and most other artists is that I work with a medium which has its own intrinsic life – which, of itself, has the power to move in time. In working on this moving medium I try to",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms .

"" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer .

He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission .

" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","external fertilization and had an amphibian mode of life with a metamorphosis to a terrestrial adult.  Few temnospondyls, including Dissorophidae and Chigutisaurus , are known from the fossils of hatched or unborn young . These hatched as fully developed and were able to swim at once . The only known amphibian to give live birth was the dvinosaur Seymouria . This has a mammalian reproductive mode that is found only in some salamanders . In other species of","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
