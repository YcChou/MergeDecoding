"support from an unexpected source .marcus sounded more exasperated than understanding , however .we have other things to do today .liam was",still looking for her when we left .i had been dreading this moment for so long and now it had finally come .the last of my childhood .i wanted to savor it but i knew that if i did not say good-bye soon it would be too late .i took one last look around .then i took his hand .he took me into a room where he had some chairs arranged .there were many children seated on them .some of them had their heads buried in their hands .they seemed sad .their faces were drawn with the pain of leaving .their eyes were red from crying .,"quiet for what felt like forever , before i finally heard him sigh in agreement .my muscles relaxed .fine , he said , i learned what i came here to learn .he crouched down beside us and his voice lowered .i dont know why he bothered whispering , everyone in the room could hear him just fine .ill be back for you though , he told gabriel .i felt him tense against me and my nails dug into his back as if i could pull him even closer than he already was ."
the air was still ; she could hear him breathing under the sack .she went up on tiptoes and whispered to him .the city,"is like a woman who can be loved for many things but i have fallen in love with it for one reason only , because it is alive .he took her by the arms .i know he said .you are like no other .but how did you find me ?it is not so hard i told him .i watched your room until late at night when all the people left .then i came here .i waited .i listened .i heard your footsteps .i followed them .i knew they were leading me here .the girl began to weep and he tried to comfort her but she pushed him away .what if someone should","might burn , but you would certainly die .she felt him turn a little , and saw his silver light flash by as he did .he grunted , unable to speak behind the gag .amira reached up under the sack and loosened the cloth .go , he shouted .return to callaston .it took two days for the army to completely withdraw .they had to collect all their living and their dead , and deal with roving parties of townsfolk who , on a few occasions , started fights with the royal soldiers ."
"do you accept your place as my mate ?in the back of the crowd , i saw agent liam talking to the woman i recognized as jessica",.i have been trying to keep a low profile but it looks like she is looking for me .she has seen me with kim and now i know i need to find her before she can say anything.i see that she is still looking in my direction so i take off at a sprint hoping i can get there first .i run around a group of people and come around to where jessica is standing .i put on my most charming smile .hey jessica how are you today .oh hi mr .edward cullen how are you .you look nice .i think we may be having,"pearson , the huntsmen ringleader and i made a terrible realization .the werewolf hunters and the government were working together , and marcus had used my footage to lead them both to the pack and to gabriel .that knowledge brought me down to earth as nothing else could have .when i was silent for too long he shook me , nails digging into skin while men and women in army fatigues surrounded us and attempted to pull us apart .do you accept ?phaedra , he breathed , pressing me close , i cant do anything for you if you dont .i cant keep you safe .not against this .i accept , i sobbed as the soldiers finally managed to rip him away from me ."
ripping things apart was much more fun than talking business .* * * * elijah walker had been working with the paranormal division of,"the government for years now , but it still took him some time to get used to it . he still wondered at how his boss could take something like this and not question it too much . but , that was her job . she took care of things so he could be left to work on other things . but he did have his suspicions . but they weren&apos;t anything he could say out loud , even if it was only her to hear them . but now , it seemed like someone was looking into their dealings and trying to see just how deep it went . but who ? . it seemed like","the fbi for only two months before he was relocated to briarcliff .he hadnt expected to be using the training hed received from quantico for security detail , but he was determined to make the best of it .for almost a year hed studied all he could about werewolves , vampires , selkies , and banshees .hed perfected his skills as a sharpshooter and had practiced enough hand to hand combat to be considered the top of his class .despite his qualifications , he and the other agents had been overlooked in favor of the huntsmen who had been partnering with the feds to corral the paranormals in briarcliff .at least , that had been the case before the huntsmen had all been executed .according to agent benson , the huntsmen had different goals than the fbi .theyd wanted to kill supernaturals , while the government wanted to capture them .that they could use the deaths of the group for the benefit of the government had just been a bonus ."
"elland had a number of excellent malthouses , so shed been informed , including a few public houses , but liam had not shown much interest in","them . he seemed more concerned with his new-found friend jim , who seemed to know an awful lot about malt and how it was made , but little else .

he continued .what i mean to say is you are a character .when you started out on that cliff you were just coming into existence as an idea,"and now you have become a full-fledged character with your own story ,you are like the little mermaid who longed for human legs so she can go up on land .she did but it cost her something in return .the sea had been her world but now she wanted more than it could give .i see that in you now ,you are growing ,you are going beyond your wildest imagination .but at what cost ? .the only difference between us is that i knew where my story was leading me from day one .you still dont .sooner or later you are going to be left with only yourself",.a man named lawrence foster brickem thought you up .he gave you his face and his name and set you on your way .you are the embodiment of a story .all of us are .we are all stories that originated in peoples minds and are now in a limbo of sorts .our stories have been completed one way or another and we wait until the world is ready for us .we have it the best .
"i nodded , expecting to be asked to lead the army again .the king looked to a young woman sitting beside him .she looked to be in her","late thirties with long red hair .her eyes were deep and she seemed very confident .she had on a black gown that went down to her ankles with black heels .i took my place at her right as we began .i listened as she started .
i have been looking for someone who is like me but is still human ,who could see things from all points of view and who was smart ,compassionate and cared for his people and their lives .you are that man .the world is going through some major changes .we need your help .it is your choice ,but if you choose","early twenties like me .she had brown hair that hung in a mess down to her shoulders and bright blue eyes .now ramonia , i want you to go with this fellow here .she shook her head violently .stop it .hes smarter than all of us put together .he will keep you safe .by the end of today you might be the only one from my kingdom left ."
"it talks .hed never met a talking specter .even when hed hunted with the sidhe , the specters in their party had never",been known to speak .the one now was doing his best to explain how he d gotten here and where hed been for so long .but even at that he seemed a little fuzzy on some points .it seemed like he d been trying to keep out of trouble but couldnt .that made no sense but maybe if they went over things more clearly it might become clear .so for now he tried to take care of his immediate need first .then he might have some energy left for other things .the ghost needed some clothes .not sure how well he d look in anything from this world but it might be better than,"spoken .it made the creature less alien to know that it understood the human tongue .jeffery , he said after a moment , take point with our little friend here .hernandez , tony , and quentin ?watch our rear .jeffery wasnt the only one who sent him a look of doubt before following his instructions .leo knew what he was planning was insane , but figured that he could handle the specter if the creature suddenly turned on him and his men .in the meantime , they now had some much needed help to bring back gabriel ."
"all eyes turned to the wagon owner , unruffled in an emerald silk vest .he looked perplexed .me ?thats",me he thought .i did it ?the other children started crying and their parents came running from their houses .it was may day .the last may day i remember .i had been looking for him .but now i have him .i took him into my room .we went out on the porch .there were many things we wanted to tell each other but we couldnt speak .soon his body stopped shaking .then we began to run .i pushed him over and over .i kicked him with my new red boots .the people who gathered around us watched without saying anything .some even seemed amused .,"ridiculous , he said calmly .master coalridge looked less certain now , his eyes darting between liam and cameron , who stepped forward through the crowd .cameron , lad .this isnt true , is it ?coalridge growled .of course not .forgive me , but everyone knows janice is yours ."
"not just knights , but wardens of aendavar .what are they doing here ?she looked again as they went by , and realized","it was the one who had been with them last time she came this way .the one who had tried to keep her from leaving .he had been trying to find her for so long , he said .but how could he have known where she lived ?it had only been because he had seen her at the gate that day .the other one who was with him now .had he been looking for her too ?no wonder he had seemed to know her when he first came into her room .the look on her face .that he knew her .that he wanted her .that he loved her .that he needed her .that he wanted","that shed seen one of them before .the one shed taken to be older , with white hair , was on closer inspection clearly the younger of the two .she couldnt remember his name , but she knew where theyd met : in the grand ballroom of elibarran , at the royal summer ball .hed paid little attention to her at the time , just about the only man at the ball who had done so .that she remembered .the party rode past her to the town square .she knew it couldnt be safe to gain their attention , but her feet carried her after them anyway .by the time she got there , theyd all dismounted , the rank and file seeing to their horses while the two wardens strode over to the magistrates office ."

"what in the name of chaos ?i never !what in the world are you talking about ?yes !it was him , i swear it !",the last one is for sure .you got no idea how many people he has killed and maimed .we have been looking for him for years now.but we couldnt find him .so we came here hoping that maybe we find him .he is very good at disguiseing .that is his only power .the one who kills without leaving any traces .i knew him long time ago .we had some adventures back in the day .we even saved each others lives a few times .we were close .then something happened .something so awful .i still dont understand .i think he blame me for it,"she sobbed , scrambling to her feet and scuttling over to cower behind coalridge .he made me , he said hed hurt me !please , dont let him red clouded liams vision .this is absurd !iim married , id never touch her !"
for once she did not appreciate the attention .she tugged on dardans hand and led him into the city .they had horses to bear them,", but still it took some time before they were at the gate of the city .the guardian was standing at his post as if he expected them .he opened his eyes in wonder when he saw her .the last time he had seen her she had been a child .the years had treated her well .her long red hair had become even longer .it reached down her back like a gently swaying banner .the black clothes that covered her body seemed to mold around her slim but shapely body like a second skin .the cloak she had over it seemed to have been woven from night .the","back to the castle .the city would be in repairs for weeks at least ; the wall needed to be rebuilt , many of the roads repaved .jeffrey beamed with pride every time they passed a section of road hed torn up .our time in elland is coming to an end , she said to dardan as they rode .you knew wed never be able to stay here forever .she nodded .it is a hard thing to admit .she looked at the faces of the townsfolk she passed ."
he paced the room again and kept muttering about how interesting this was .i definitely did not see anything interesting about the way he was acting .,"he seemed like he had been on something but i still tried not to think too much into it because it could have been my imagination .i took another swig from my can of soda .the wait for him to speak seemed like an eternity .he stopped and faced me ,then he began .
i knew she had been dating some one new so i figured that is where he got it from but it still sounded stupid .i started laughing at his story but i tried not to be to loud .i heard her footsteps in the hall .she opened the door and came inside with her friend .her friend","he must have had memory problems .he couldnt remember my name three seconds after i told it to him .i was starting to wonder if i could leave without him noticing so i could find my deepest desire .you .he said , pointing at me .you are the most interesting character ive ever met .and you are the most interesting character ive ever met .come with me somewhere else ."
"only he didnt stop pulling once i was free .cold rage suffused his features , sending the amber to swell and drown out the",black .i tried to fight him but it was like trying to fight an angry ghost .the world started to blur around me .then my eyes snapped open .he had been standing over me for so long .but now his body was still .i pushed him away with one last desperate jerk of my legs .the room began to swim before me again .the cold was growing worse .the door .i could see it .the handle .the doorknob .the handle .the door .the handle .the door .the handle .the handle .the handle .the handle .the handle .the,"white of his eyes .he paled , and his lips drew back from lengthening teeth , canines snapping as the muscles in his arms and shoulders worked .he ripped the bottom half of the wolfs jaw apart and threw the bloody part into the inner depths of the room , grinning madly when the part of the pack it had landed amongst fell upon it with hungry yips .the wolf hed mangled collapsed at his feet , paws clawing the air as its pain filled cries joined the cacophony .my arm had grown numb , and i reached over with my still working hand to touch the wound with gentle fingers .i stared down at the blood that coated my hand and felt the world shift ominously beneath my feet .i wanted to pass out , i probably needed to pass out , but i had something else to worry about now .the wolves surrounding me caught the scent of my blood and it seemed to overpower whatever protection gabriels lingering odor had leant me .their heads lowered as one , their eyes grew heated and hungry , and their ears went flat ."

Chapter One
My dad is going to kill me.
My stomach flips like it always does when he gets angry at me. My chest hurts because it feels like something is trying to escape from inside it. The world looks blurry around the edges and it feels like someone is slowly squeezing my heart until it explodes.

"his golden armor was returned to him , but he would not take it , giving no explanation .amira felt an urge to simply kill him now",", she did not have much of an interest in him anyway and if he wanted to be left to the world so badly than let it be , but her eyes still watched him for any change . he seemed to have been completely over come with this world .she shook her head at him . he seemed so very child like now. he seemed like a child who had been denied their candy for days on end and when given it back it did nothing for them anymore .he seemed like he did not even care .she wondered how long she could wait before he did anything at all .it seemed like it had been years , but it",", but dardan had given his word , and she would not betray that .she held his left hand .his right was maimed ; his little finger had been shortened by one knuckle , and his ring finger by two , by penroses strike .still he wore his plain gold wedding ring on the stump of the finger .penrose had not been seen since that fight .he had probably fled the city and was already on his way back to callaston .somehow , that distant threat loomed over her more than edon , who stood not five yards before her .surrounded by hostile mages , he was harmless .he glared at amira again ."
