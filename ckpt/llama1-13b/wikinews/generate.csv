"On Monday, the Israeli army withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Palestinians rejoiced over this occasion, with Mahmoud Abb","as saying that it was a ""day of national unity and peace,"" while others have been out on the streets to celebrate the end of the three-week long war between Israel and the Islamist movement, Hamas. The United States also praised the decision by the Israelis to end their military operations in the Gaza Strip, but they have yet to make an announcement as to what will be done now about the continuing rocket attacks into Israel from the region.
Hamas has announced that they are going to try to take back the areas that were under the control of Fatah before the recent conflict","as saying that ""This is a day of happiness and joy that the Palestinian people have not witnessed for a century.""

The 38 years of Israeli presence in the Gaza strip have officially ended.

Palestinians were overjoyed at the sight of the burning synagogues, planting flags in the midst of it all, and shouting cries of independence. Teenagers set fire to a few synagogues, letting out anger at Israel's occupation.

The fires did little damage to the concrete structures, but Abbas said that the Palestinians planned to destroy them fully.

Palestinian police admitted that there was not much they could or would do to stop this.

Last year, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy the synagogues, but this Sunday, under pressure from religious Jewish organizations, it reversed its decision. Palestinians were angry at the cabinet's Sunday vote.

The synagogues, as well as all community structures, including community centers, schools, and sports facilites, are the only physical remnants of the Israeli Gaza Strip presence since all residential structures have been destroyed."
"Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, today announced that the 2004/2005 season of the National Hockey League",was cancelled. The decision to cancel the season was based on a vote by the owners who have been at an impasse with the NHL Players' Association since last Friday. The two sides had been working under a deadline of this week in which they would either have reached a new collective bargaining agreement or face the loss of the entire 2004-05 season. The announcement was made during a conference call between all of the teams and the media. The decision to cancel the entire 2004-05 season has been criticized by many as being too drastic and,"has been canceled. The announcement served only as official comfirmation of what was generally expected as wild speculation had raged during the past few days. The dispute centered around player pay caps, which where staunchly opposed by the players. The majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount. The club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million. Speaking about the cancellation, Gary Bettman said ""The shame of this is that our fans deserve better.""

This will be the first year since 1919 that the Stanley Cup - the top prize in the NHL - will not be awarded. That year, a flu epidemic forced the finals to be called off."

Nation of Islam and Arab nation: Rejoice for it is time to take revenge against the British Zionist Crusader government in retaliation for the massacres Britain is committing in Iraq and Afghanistan. The heroic mujahideen have carried out a blessed raid in London. Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters.

We have repeatedly warned the British Government and people. We have fulfilled our promise and carried out our blessed military raid in Britain after our mujahideen exerted strenuous efforts over a long period of time to ensure the success of the raid.

We continue to warn the governments of Denmark and Italy and all the Crusader governments that they will be punished in the same way if they do not withdraw their troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. He who warns is excused.

Molson Canada picks up Creemore Springs Brewery Ltd. as the company maneuvers to make an entry into the craft beer,"market. The $20-million acquisition, announced Friday, will be a game-changer in the brewing world in Ontario and across the country, say analysts.
CALGARY: Molson Canada has acquired the Ontario-based micro-brewery, Creemore Springs, as it prepares to take on the burgeoning craft beer market.
Molson said the $20 million cash transaction for 100% of the outstanding common shares of the company was approved by both companies' board of directors. The company plans to have the be","market.

Creemore Springs of Creemore, Ontario, produces the locally popular Creemore Springs lager. The merger will allow the company to retain its identity.

""The Creemore brand image and brewing craft will remain unchanged,"" Creemore Springs Brewery chairman Bill Wilder said. ""Molson understands and appreciates what is special about the Creemore brand and this makes them a great purchaser for the company.""

Industry observers are mixed on the benefits of the deal for Molson. The CBC reports one analyst suggests Molson may be trying to replicate the success of rival Labatt's premium beers. Others point out the small brewery model does not scale up well, and the attraction of a ""boutique"" beer fades in large-scale production.

Molson Coors Brewing Co., formed by the US$3.4 billion merger in February of two family-run companies, Canadian Molson and U.S. Coors brewing companies, is the fifth largest brewer in the world by volume. ( TSX:TAP.NV, NYSE:TAP)"
The World Health Organisation has announced that the number of people receiving anti-retroviral treatments (ART) in developing countries is increasing significantly - more,"than 1 million people were on the drug last year, a rise of 20% since the previous year. The increase was seen in both Africa and the Caribbean. However, this does not represent the whole of the continent or region, as South Africa alone has over half of all those treated with anti-retrovirals in sub-Saharan Africa, while only 8% of HIV-infected people are getting the medication in West and Central Africa. In the Caribbean, it was found that just under half of the infected population have been able to access the medications,","than doubling between December 2003 and June 2005. One million people are now getting the drugs they need, compared to just 400,000 eighteen months ago.

However, access to treatment is not growing as fast as demand, and the UN is unlikely to reach its target of treating three million people by the end of 2005 - just over half the people who need it. The longer-term target of universal treatment by 2010 is still likely to be met.

The figures show that the number of people receiving ART is increasing in every part of the globe, but not as quickly as people are contracting HIV. The numbers getting treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, the part of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS has increased threefold on a year ago, and doubled in the last six months. The same rate of growth as also been seen in Asia, the second-worst affected area.

The WHO's report highlights that the best progress has been made when governments have worked together with the WHO, the UN and other parterners. The report goes on to make recommendations for simplifying the process to enable treatment levels to be increased even faster.

The UN's target was based on what was hypothetically possible if all possible steps to provide treatment were taken. The report shows the while financial, political and technical steps have been made, other areas are falling short.

Pressure groups said that countries were reacting too slowly to the pandemic and called on the G8 to provide more sustainable funding for universal treatment for Aids.

UK international development minister Gareth Thompson said: ""We are committed to universal access to HIV treatments by 2010. We will spend £1.5bn in the next three years on Aids, including £150m on orphans."""
A recent survey conducted by the American Cancer Society has turned up some surprising results: Americans generally hold false beliefs about the nature of cancer and its treatment,". In this blog, Dr. Michael Berman discusses the most common cancer-related misconceptions that were uncovered in the survey and why these misconceptions may be a threat to public health.
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, second only to heart disease. As the number of people who have or will develop cancer grows, it becomes ever more important to make sure that all members of society are aware of the dangers of cancer and know the most effective methods of preventing and treating this deadly disease. The American Cancer Society (ACS) has",", even though many believe they are well informed.

Health experts say this ignorance could be dangerous: People may be making poor health decisions -- avoiding cancer screenings or rejecting potentially life-saving treatments -- based on their incorrect notions.

The most common misconception is that surgery causes cancer to spread. Decades ago, cancer often was not discovered until it was very advanced. At that stage, surgical efforts were rarely successful, and many patients died soon after procedures were performed. This may have given rise to the mistaken belief that the surgeries caused the disease to worsen.

Another commonly held myth is that there is a cure for cancer, but the medical industry is withholding it in order to continue profiting from the sale of less effective treatments and medications.

Believers in this ""conspiracy theory"" may not be guided by it in making their personal health decisions, though. The American Cancer Society says that even though many people are suspicious of the medical industry in general, they have a trusting relationship with their own physicians and are likely to follow their advice.

Almost 20 percent of the people surveyed felt that medications for cancer pain were ineffective.

About 10 percent expressed the belief that cancer could be cured with a positive attitude alone, while a similar number felt that there was no effective treatment for cancer.

The fact is, cancer survival and treatments -- including pain management -- have vastly improved in the last thirty years.

Results of the survey appear in the August 1 issue of Cancer, a journal published by the American Cancer Society."

Iraq has carried out the first executions since the demise of the Saddam Hussein regime. Three men convicted of murder were hanged,"in public, as a crowd of onlookers and police watched. The three had been found guilty of killing two people during looting last year. It was the first time that the new Iraqi authorities have used the death penalty since they took over from US-led occupation forces in June. Iraq is not a signatory to the 1948 Convention against Torture, but it does recognise the right to life. In April this year the then Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said he would use the death penalty if it helped to stop violence. He also said that all those who committed at","on Thursday morning in Baghdad.

The Iraqi government argues that the death penalty will help to deter criminals but spokesman Laith Kubba admitted that ""this is not an easy thing to do"".

Iraqi president Jalal Talabani is personally opposed to capital punishment and stated that he would never sign a death sentence, not even against Saddam Hussein himself. His deputy Adel Abdel Mehdi signed the warrant instead.

Human rights groups and the United Nations had hoped Iraq would refrain from using the death penalty against its citizens and urged the government not to carry out the sentences.

"&amp;ndash; According to The Times, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom The Right Honourable Anthony Charles Lynton Blair wants to","be a Catholic when he is no longer in office. He says that his decision has been long-in-coming and that it was inspired by the example of St. Thomas More. &amp;nbsp;The 15th-century statesman and Lord Chancellor of England was executed on charges of treason for refusing to sign King Henry VIII's Oath of Succession, which would have legitimized the King's marriage to his second wife, Anne Boleyn, who had not been married in a Catholic Church. &amp;nbsp;Blair said that the more he has thought","involve the United States of America in efforts to reduce anthropogenic interference with Earth's climates. Historically, the United Kingdom's closest partner in this endeavor has been the Federal Republic of Germany. The United States government has famously refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Blair sais also that the Kyoto Protocol doesn't go far enough. He would like to involve the private sector also and he has put this item on top of the G8, so all the large countries of the world have to talk about it.

Mr Byers said yesterday: ""The reality is that unless we can get the United States engaged - responsible as it is for around a quarter of the world's carbon dioxide emissions - then any hopes of successfully tackling global warming will be doomed to failure.

Some sources are saying, Blair is saying these things because he can make the more progressive voters change their mind, so they would vote for him."
Brazil is threatening to break the patent of US-based Abbott Laboratories as it pushes ahead with its programme to supply its people with,"low-cost HIV and hepatitis medications, reports Reuters. The company says that if the South American nation does this, it will file a lawsuit in the World Trade Organization (WTO), but the country has been at the centre of an ongoing row over access to life-saving medication since 2017 when President Jair Bolsonaro first announced his plans to issue a compulsory licence, which would enable the government to manufacture the drug without paying for a licence from the original company. The decision was suspended while the two sides discussed the situation but","free AIDS drugs.

Brazil has given Abbott a deadline of July 7 to cut the prices of its drug Kaletra or a Brazilian company will begin cloning it. This move would test recent World Trade Organization concessions allowing poor countries to produce generic drugs for local health emergencies.

Abbott has said that Brazil's demand goes ""against the spirit"" of the WTO agreement, since it has the ninth largest economy in the world, and that this could damage future research for improved treatments.

Previous programmes have been negotiated between companies and governments to produce generic versions of AIDS drugs, but this is the first time a country has threatened to use powers negotiated at the WTO by producing the drug without the cooperation of the patent holder.

Several campaign groups are supporting the move, hoping that other developing countries will be able to take the lead of Brazil and produce generic drugs for their own populations. Michael Bailey, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam International, said: ""The impact of breaking the patent would be enormous. If a major country such as Brazil goes through with this, not only will it help ensure sustainability of their excellent treatment programme, it will set a hugely important precedent for other countries.""

The US Chamber of Commerce has issued a statement urging Brazil to reconsider and suggesting that the move could create a rift between the countries. Thomas Donohue, Chamber President and CEO said: ""Brazil’s threat to strip patent rights from a U.S. company should concern all investors and every business around the world because of the precedent it sets for the treatment of intellectual property."""
Millions of origami cranes have been dropped on Thailand's three southern provinces following violence between the government and ethnic minority Muslim populations,". The paper cranes, a symbol of peace in Japan, are being used by both sides to try to end the unrest that has killed at least 70 people since January. The latest outbreak of violence began last Friday with the burning down of two schools by the army in Pattani. On Saturday the military were involved in another clash with insurgents which killed four people and injured five. In response to this attack the authorities launched air and ground assaults in the region which they say killed at least 21 suspected separatists and led to the arrest of more than 30 others.",". The move has been called a ""goodwill gesture"" towards Muslims.

Up to 120 million such paper sculptures were dropped on Thailand's three southern-most provinces, Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. Tensions in this area have increased recently, peaking with the recent death of 85 demonstrators arrested during a protest. The government blamed their deaths on physical weakness due to fasting in the month of Ramadan as the cause, as most if not all the deaths occurred during transport of up to 500 arrested protestors. Critics of the Thai government have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, blaming the ""over-eagerness"" of Thai security forces as the cause of the deaths.

The dispersal was timed to coincide with the birthday of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and has generated much interest from the rest of the country's predominantly Buddhist population.
The cranes were built by citizens throughout Thailand and had peace messages written on them. The southern, Muslim provinces are often considered neglected by a north that is larger and of the majority ethnic group. Some have welcomed the goodwill gesture, but critics in both the north and south have said that the resources would have been better spent solving the problems in the south. Some Islamic leaders in the south have also expressed concerns that the gesture may not be properly understood by Muslims, as the crane carries no cultural significance with them."
"In the wake of a United States Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. New London on eminent domain last week, a California man has proposed","to make it more difficult for state and local governments to take land from people through the power of eminent domain.
Senate Bill 207 by Sen. Dennis Hollingsworth (R-Murrieta), would amend the state's constitution to say that property may be taken only if there is ""an immediate public use"" of the land. The bill was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
Hollingsworth said he believes his proposal will have an effect on future cases of eminent domain, which are being considered in other states as well.
""We want to put","that Justice David Souter's New Hampshire home be seized by the state and a hotel be built on the site. Logan Darrow Clements faxed a letter to town officials in Weare, New Hampshire June 28, 2005 that justified the action as such:

""The justification for such an eminent domain action is that our hotel will better serve the public interest as it will bring in economic development and higher tax revenue to Weare.""

Justice Souter, who was in the majority ruling in the Kelo case, has lived at the farmhouse in Weare since he was 11 years old. Clements indicated that it was necessary to build on that location because ""it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans."" The action has given rise to a great deal of support nationwide, as many are writing to the councilors of the small town of Weare to voice their approval for the proposal.

The proposal for the ""Lost Liberty Hotel"", as it is to be called, features a number of components which seem to focus on the libertarian leanings of its designer. A dining room, called the ""Just Desserts Cafe"" and a museum based on the ""loss of freedom in America"" are two such components. Instead of a Bible provided by the Gideons (a standard item placed in most American hotel rooms), each guest will receive a free copy of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged."
People all over the Netherlands are voting today in a referendum on the EU constitution. This the first national referendum for two hundred years and it is non,"-binding, meaning that the result has no effect on policy. The only other time there was a vote on this issue was in Ireland last year when they voted 'No' to the treaty. However, as with many of these issues, it's more than just about the text of the document and people have been asked to vote on the whole process of European integration and their hopes and fears for the future of Europe. The polling stations will stay open for fourteen hours and turnout is expected to be very high. The Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said he would resign if the No side won and his","-binding. Though most major political parties have stated they will abide by the referendum if the outcome is sufficiently clear and a large enough percentage of the voters have actually voted.
The question put to voters will be:

:Bent U voor of tegen instemming door Nederland met het verdrag tot vaststelling van een grondwet voor Europa?
:""Are you for or against approval by the Netherlands of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe?""

All the main political parties have asked for a voor (for, or yes) vote. However polls have been saying that two-thirds of the people will be voting tegen (against, or no).

One reason for people to vote no is the expansion of the European Union with large countries like Turkey, which they fear will cause less influence for the smaller countries. The view of an European super state in which the Netherlands would loose its own identity is another reason for voting no. Some of the no voters do this to show they don't agree with the current political situation and the supposed risen prices since the introduction of the euro.

As of 14:00 CET, 9% more voters had turned up for the referendum than for the European elections.

People from all over Australia are protesting against the Australian Government's policy of mandatory detention. The first protesters arrived by buses in Port Augusta early Friday morning.

Detainees seem split over the protest. The Age reported Detainee Peter Qasim as saying, ""It stops people from visiting us, it stops us receiving any calls. It is a good idea to protest but better somewhere other than here.""

However, other detainees have been reported as saying, ""It is better in front of Baxter, I believe showing Baxter, protesters will shout about human torture inside detention. Then there would be good publicity about all torture inside Baxter detention.""

And, ""We welcome all of the protesters and we thank them all who has seen disgrace of this human torture. Further we thank to you all who come and visit and looking after us all the time, we need it.""

"Some 500,000 people gathered today in Rome to march silently, demanding the liberation of Giuliana Sgrena,","a kidnapped Italian journalist who was released last Friday from her Iraqi kidnappers by American troops. The crowd chanted slogans against U.S. and Israeli war on the Middle East.

"At UN World Headquarters in New York on Friday, February 4, 2005, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations",", Dr. Adnan Pachachi, was sworn in as President of the Security Council for the month of February. The swearing-in took place at a special meeting called by Ambassador Pachachi and co-sponsored by his fellow members of the Council, which has been divided since the war began into two groups - those that are pro-US and those that are anti-US. The swearing-in of an Arab president of the Council is unprecedented, but it has been long overdue, according to many observers. The last time the Council elected a president from a Middle Eastern state",", Samir Sumaidaie, declared to reporters that the international body of the United Nations helped the regime of Saddam Hussein. This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's Oil-for-Food program with Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali although there is no charge against him in the report.

In an interview with Voice of America reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie said: ""In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later.... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program.""

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.

After being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said: ""Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him.""

On Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: ""We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it."""
"Bitmover, the company producing a management program for computer source code named Bitkeeper (BK), announced on April 5 that it will no longer","be releasing BK as free software. The decision was based on the fact that many of those who use BK are not paying the $100 yearly subscription fee to access BK. In other words, they're ""pirating"" it. Bitmover says this has reduced their revenue by about half and forced them to cut back on the number of developers they have on the project.
While some may think this is just another example of the problems with free software (i.e. you can't make money selling software if people are going to take it without paying","be providing a free version of its product.

As a result of Bitmover's announcement, the programmer who wrote the original Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds, stated on a mailing list that he ""decided to not use BK mainly because he needs to figure out the alternatives"". As to an alternative to Bitkeeper, Torvalds hinted that he is considering Monotone but that Subversion, a recent replacement for CVS, is out of the running. Bitkeeper was originally developed to allow Torvalds to manage code contributions more easily, according to Jeremy Andrews at Kerneltrap.org, and was previously provided to kernel developers free of charge, though it was restricted in its use.

Bitkeeper is the software that Torvalds and hundreds of other Linux developers use to manage submissions of code to the Linux kernel, the heart of the computer operating systems referred to as ""Linux"" or ""GNU/Linux"". Linux is distributed in many different forms, bundled with other software by companies such as Red Hat, Novell, and Linspire.

While the details are not clear, it appears from Andrews' article that Bitmover's decision to stop releasing the free version of Bitkeeper is related to a dispute with Torvalds' employer, Open Source Development Labs (OSDL).

According to Kerneltrap, an OSDL contractor had been reverse engineering the free version of Bitkeeper in order to make an open source replacement, which is prohibited by the license under which the free version of Bitkeeper is released. Nevertheless, Torvalds notes in his post that he is ""personally very happy with BK, and with Larry McVoy, the CEO of Bitmover."""

The victims of the accident were identified as Mr. Stephen Miller and Ms. Brianna Marshall. The money will be used by the family to meet their financial requirements and also to take care of their other expenses. The decision was announced by the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison.

Under the government's proposal, depending on the amount of exposure, a worker can expect to receive between A$10,000 and A$40,000 (US $7,500 - $30,000) to help cope with the side effects. The aircraft maintenance program started in the 1970s and was suspended in the late 1990s when the former workers started to show signs of medical problems ranging from memory loss to neurological problems.

The F-111 Deseal/Reseal Support Group responded to the government's package with anger. The Group's president Ian Fraser said ""A$40,000 for a ruined life is simply not enough ... We've already got people who have died, who are dying, people who have lost their homes.""

The teams will now take part in the ODIs which are starting in February. # A","with the other two tests drawn. Australia won the first Test comfortably, but the Second Test saw England level the series with a two run victory that was the narrowest win in Ashes history. The third Test ended in a draw (with England one wicket away from a win), and England narrowly won the fourth Test in Nottingham by three wickets after the English enforced follow on after a poor first innings by Australia.

The fifth and final Test started on 8 September at the Oval in London. It entered its final day evenly balanced with all results still possible and the destination of the urn still in doubt. Australia needed to win to force a 2-2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give them to England, ending 18 years and eight series of Australian dominance. In the end, England managed to bat out the final day, and a draw ensured the Ashes were coming back to England.

Kevin Pietersen and Ashley Giles hit personal bests of 158 and 59 respectively, to bat out the best part of the last day. Pieterson's 158 was his maiden test century, and included 7 sixes. Early in the day, Australia looked to be in with a chance of winning the match, with early wickets leaving England at 67 for 3. Giles and Pietersen's century partnership, though, left Australia with no hope of catching England in the remains of the day, sealing England's Ashes win since 1987.

England's next Tests will be an away series in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the world champions Australia will play an ICC World XI (which inclues Kevin Pietersen, Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff) in the Johnnie Walker Super Series in early October."
Space.com reported yesterday on a picture of a planet taken by the Very Large Telescope located in Chile. The European Southern Observatory's,"20-ton, four-telescope VLT is one of the world's largest and most productive ground-based telescopes, with the largest main mirrors (8.2 meter or 324 inches across), which allows it to take very detailed and clear photos of other planets. This planet was called ""WASP-17b"" by the team that found it in the southern sky last year. They discovered this planet when they were observing another star for changes in brightness that would be caused by a planet orbiting it. The planet has been classified as a ""","telescope, which was used to capture the picture, has made the first confirmed discovery of a planet orbiting another star.

Scientists have been trying to locate planets outside our own solar system for nearly 10 years. Inferences of nearly 150 planets in other solar systems have been observed so far by using instruments and measurements that only suggest the existence of another planet. Until now, no planet has been confirmed by the means of a photographed image. There was, months earlier, another team of scientists who took pictures of what might be another planet, but that image remains controversial because it shows what may be an even more distant object instead.

The research team that photographed the planet with its host star was led by Ralph Neuhaeuser of the Astrophysical Institute &amp; University Observatory (AIU). ""The detection of the faint object near the bright star is certain,"" he told Space.com on Friday.

The new image contains the star, GQ Lupi, with an orbiting planet. It is smaller than our sun, 70% the size, and is located 400 light-years away from our solar system. The planet is nearly twice the size of Jupiter. Unlike our sun which is 4.6 billion years old, the GQ Lupi star is approximately 1 million years old and is considered very young for a star. The planet orbiting GQ Lupi is three times further out than Neptune's orbit around our sun, and scientists estimate the orbiting period to be about 1,200 years. The planets wide orbiting distance from the GQ Lupi was an important element for enabling the photograph to be taken.

The planet, much like the star it orbits, is very hot &amp;mdash; about 2,000 degrees Kelvin &amp;mdash; so despite the detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, which at that temperature would make it gaseous, there is no expectation it might support life.

The discovery will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics."
"Young Quakers who planned to take part in the World Gathering of Young Friends at Lancaster University, England have been unable to attend after having","their visa applications turned down. The decision follows a policy by the UK Government which has denied visas to all Iranian nationals for travel to the United Kingdom since 2012. The group had applied for visas on the basis that they were travelling as tourists and would return home on the expiry of the visas, but this was not accepted by the UK Government. The decision has left many of those affected very distressed and concerned about the future of international meetings of this sort. The Meeting House is aware of other groups from outside Europe who are also being prevented from attending.","their visas denied.

Their absence has been a cause of ""hurt"" at the meetings. Sara Wolcott of Pacific Yearly Meeting on the Western coast of America wrote in a journal on the WGYF website: ""I saw in a workshop for Friends planning to meet in Kenya how much the absence of so many Friends was felt; the gathering felt incomplete. We desperately wanted our brothers and sisters to be with us, I know they wanted to be here too.""

Most of the denials were for economic reasons, if someone doesn't have a high enough income or a fixed job it can be assumed that they will stay in the country for work. Representatives from the gathering now plan to go to Kenya in October to share some of the programme with those who were unable to come.

Despite the missing Friends, the gathering has brought together a mix of different Quaker traditions in a positive atmosphere that has been appreciated by participants. Many Quakers worship in silence (unprogrammed meetings) while others, particularly in America and Africa, have ministers like other churches. Quakers also have differences of opinion over theological issues, including even the existence of God, but the young Friends have not found this to be an obstacle to coming together. Unlike many traditional Christian sects, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, encourage each member to explore his or her own relationship with God.

Chrissy Muhr of Northwest Yearly Meeting (Northwest US) wrote: ""I've been really impressed by how the mix of worship styles has been handled. Almost all the programmed Friends I've spoken to have some prior experience of unprogrammed worship. For me, the hardest thing has been not falling asleep during long periods of silence - the long week has begun to take its toll."""

The new design also has raised intaglio features to make them more easily recognizable for blind people. The new note will go into circulation this October. The old design will remain in circulation for approximately two years before they are all replaced by the new one. The last time the $10 note was redesigned was 1928.

The $10 bill is the third US bill to switch from the traditional green. The $20 and $50 bills were redesigned to feature color within the past two years.

The improvements in digital technology have made it much easier for counterfeiters. ""Ten years ago, 1 percent of (counterfeit) bills were produced on digital equipment. These days, 56 percent are produced on digital equipment, and the technology is more accessible to the general population,"" said Eric Zahren, spokesman for the Secret Service.

According to the Treasury Department, to be able to keep ahead of counterfeiters currency will need to continue to be updated every seven to ten years. The $10 bill was last redesigned in 2000. ""The intention was not to create a counterfeit-proof note&amp;mdash;which is basically impossible&amp;mdash;but one that's harder to duplicate and easier to authenticate,"" said Zahren. This new bill includes many new and enhanced security features such as color-shifting ink, a watermark, microprinting and a security thread

House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers (D-MI), in a statement issued this week, announced that he has asked his subcommittees to begin investigations of ""alleged violations of civil and criminal law"" surrounding the 2004 Presidential Election. The first order of business is to seek documents from the Republican National Committee. The second will be to issue subpoenas if they do not cooperate.
Conyers also said that he would request information on allegations that","to a Dec. 23 letter from House Representative David Wu (D-OR).

Thousands of Ohio citizens have reported experiencing problems casting their votes due to long lines at polling places, malfunctioning voting machines, inexplicable numbers of votes cast, and disenfranchisement in urban areas.

""The integrity of our democracy is at stake. We need to give the American people confidence that each and every vote will be properly counted and that the democratic electoral process is respected,"" Wu said. ""I also understand concerns about the conflict of interest of having an official in charge of running elections in a key state also heading a presidential campaign. I agree that Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell's dual role calls into question any election decision he made that favored Republicans.""

Other Congressmen including John Conyers (D-MI), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and Robert Wexler (D-FL) voiced similar concerns, and requested an investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), citing specific cases in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, and California.

In December, Conyers, the Ranking Democrat on the House Committee on the Judiciary, issued a series of letters about voting irregularities to the media, campaign officials, and manufacturers of voting equipment. These letters seek to collect and preserve information regarding the conduct of the election.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office previously reported on voting irregularities in eariler presidential elections.

A September 14, 2004 GAO report on the 2000 presidential elections detailed changes the DOJ implemented to try to ensure voter access to polls, and the importance of monitoring election-day activities. The report warned that allegations in the 2000 election lacked sufficient specifics to enable the DOJ to perform and adequate investigation and recommended that more precise information be collected regarding voting for the 2004 presidential election."
"Missing American teen Natalee Holloway, who vanished on the Dutch island of Aruba two weeks ago, is feared to be","dead.
An investigation has been opened into the possible kidnapping and murder of 18-year-old Holloway.

Additionally, three teenagers who were believed to be the last people to have seen Halloway are now under custody. Among the three teenagers is 18-year-old Satish Kalpoe, 21-year-old Depak Kalpoe, and 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, a friend of the brothers and son to a Judicial Servant.

"A Romanian student officer on mission in Iraq, Major Robertino Ciobanu, was wounded on Sunday by a bullet fired unintentionally",from the side of another Romanian officer. The two had been out on a foot patrol when the incident took place. The other officer has been identified as 2nd Lt. Ionuţ Danescu and he will be charged with careless handling of his weapon. The wound to the leg is serious but not life-threatening. The officer who shot him has been arrested pending investigation. The two had been part of the same group of officers involved in the killing of three Romanians at the weekend. The two are both members of the 101st Mechanized Infantry Division (based,"by a colleague from the multinational force in the country. The injury took place in front of the Presidential Palace of Baghdad.

The officer's colleague accidentally fired on him while unloading weapons, a standard procedure for military personnel when they are returning from patrol missions. Ciobanu was wounded in the leg, but after being treated at hospital, he was declared out of danger.

Major Ciobanu is currently involved in training new Iraqi security personnel. Romania has one of the largest contingents in Iraq, with 830 soldiers. At the end of March, three Romanian journalists were kidnapped in Iraq, with the kidnappers later demanding that Romania pull its troops out of the country or else the journalists would be killed."

The new gTLDs are likely to include domains with country codes, cities, regions and groups. This would make the total number of domains available on the web increase by as much as 1000% or more.

Representatives of both the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) signed a peace pledge today in the,"southern town of Nimule. The two sides have been at war since 1983, when the south was still part of the Republic of Sudan. The civil war killed about two-and-a-half million people before it was suspended by a truce in 2002. The United States says the new agreement will be an important step towards lasting peace.
Speaking for the SPLM was their military spokesman, General Bior Alier. He said that the agreement would end all hostilities between the two sides, but added that they will remain on high alert to prevent","Kenyan capital Nairobi, under the watchful eye of United Nations ambassadors.

According to the BBC, the document concluded with a memorandum saying that ""prompt completion of the peace process is essential for all the people of Sudan"". The actual peace treaty should, according to the pledge, be signed no later than December 31st 2004. While the pledge focuses mainly on the fights between the rebels in the south and the Khartoum-based government in the north, there is also attention for the ongoing crisis in east Sudan (Darfur).

Several aid agencies have criticized the UN for taking a weak stand against the Sudanese government. The Security Council has already signed two resolutions threatening economic sanctions against Sudan if the government does not disarm its troops in Darfur, but, so the BBC reports, the violence is continuing. The civil war in Darfur was sparked in 2003, when insurgents started attacking government buildings. The Arab government in Khartoum subsequently sent troops to the region, which have been reported to mass-violate human rights of the black Africans living in Darfur."
"In anticipation of a Security Council vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the International Criminal Court, Sudan announced today it would reject","any decision to have the cases referred to The Hague.
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Ahmed Karti said that if the United Nations Security Council votes in favor of the court, which has been backed by the United States and many other countries, ""it will be considered as a violation of the sovereignty of the state.""
""We will consider this decision a threat to peace and stability in the region,"" he told a news conference in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, after meeting with his Egyptian counterpart.
Earlier in the day, the foreign ministers of the","any United Nations resolution that required war crimes suspects to be tried abroad. The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the French delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week.

Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, ""Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese &amp;mdash; whether he is a rebel or government official &amp;mdash; outside the Sudan: we are totally against it."" In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group ""Justice and Equality of Movement,"" said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace.

Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to human rights abuses in Darfur. Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts.

The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias. It has often been suggested that this qualifies as genocide, and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights."

"Last night, CNN's Anderson Cooper played a chilling police audio tape of a 1991 confession made by the accused killer","of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman. The man identified on the recording as ""O.J."" is unmistakable in both voice and inflection.
And while it was O.J.'s first-person confession to the crime that has been at the core of this case from day one, it was his commentary about what he saw when he got home that was truly stunning.
""When I went outside to go down there,"" said O.J. (identified only by the last letter of his first name), ""and saw all this blood on the sidewalk","of 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford. On the tape, John E. Couey is heard admitting to molesting a young girl in her own backyard. For the crime he was subsequently charged, convicted and imprisoned for 2 years.

An accompanying written report by the officer who took the taped confession says; ""Couey admitted that this was not the first child he had ever touched, however, this is the first time he was caught."" The officer continues, ""Couey admitted to molesting his wife's daughter, however, she agreed not to report the incident if he left the house and gave her a divorce, which he did."" CNN was unable to locate Couey's former wife.

The revelation calls into question the way Couey has been dealt with by officials over the years. He spoke on the 1991 tape about how he ""needs help"" and ""wants help"".

Mary Doyle, a Citrus County probation official, said Monday that if they had known Couey was a registered sex offender, they may have been able to keep him away from Jessica Lunsford. Florida Courts do not provide probation workers with criminal backgrounds of their probationers, even in the case of registered sexual offenders like Couey, Doyle said. With that information they might have tried harder to locate him when he failed to report in with probation officials last November. When detectives did finally catch up with him, they learned he had been living across the road from Jessica."
Australians and New Zealanders throughout the world stood still for their national war memorial days in remembrance of the failed Australian and New Zealand Army Corps,"(ANZAC) attack at the Dardanelles. The 2017 Anzac Day National Service, which was broadcasted on all television stations, was a sobering and humbling experience, as it has been since I first saw it when I was a kid in Australia. The service commences with the last post played by the Royal New Zealand Airforce Band, then follows with the Ode read by the Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove. Then there is the wreath-laying, with each state represented by the governor or other representatives, and then the two minutes of","&amp;mdash; ANZAC &amp;mdash; attack on Gallipoli, Turkey that began on 25 April 1915. The fateful attack was designed to end the First World War more quickly by creating a supply line to Russia. A hundred-thousand died in the battle, remembered every year as ANZAC Day by both nations.

The British-directed battle of Gallipoli is often seen as the defining moment in the 'birth' of Australia and New Zealand. With New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark saying ""For New Zealand as for Australia it was at Gallipoli that our young nations came of age."" . This being the 90th anniversary of the attack, Clark, Australian Prime Minister John Howard and Britain's Prince Charles are all at Gallipoli to remember that fateful campaign.

Some controversy has been created about Australian Prime Minister John Howard not attending the New Zealand ceremony at Chunuk Bair on the Gallipoli Peninsula. This has upset many people as it is a break in a tradition that the Prime Ministers attend the ceremonies of both countries."

The United States has been at war in the country since 2001, yet the situation has worsened in many areas. The number of drug-related killings is on the rise. In the first two months of this year alone, more than 80 people were killed by explosives or ambushes that may be connected to the drug trade. The number of civilian deaths from air attacks also rose sharply, according to the U.N.

On Sunday's CNN's Late Edition, Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai laid the blame for the explosion of opium production in his country at the feet of the US and Britain. ""This particular operation in Kandahar or in other parts of the country, which have not been so successful, was supposed to be done by an agency, a department that was funded by the international community, by the United States, by Britain. The failure is theirs, not ours."" Kazai said. ""Where international money and creation of forces for destruction of poppies was concerned, it was ineffective and delayed and half-hearted.""

Karzai was responding to allegations in Sunday's New York Times that his government was dragging their heels in reducing the opium production in Afghanistan. In Kandahar Province last week, farmers were visible from the main road scraping the last resin from poppy plants. That location is just 10 minutes outside the provincial capital."

"The Senator Julian McGauran in the Australian Senate had made an ""unseemly"" gesture across the floor of the Senate whilst it was in session",". This is a violation of the rules and as a consequence he has been asked to resign from his position on the Privileges Committee, which has responsibility for overseeing the rules of the Senate. The issue has become more than a breach of the rules - it has become a breach of the very basis of the Parliament's power to make those rules. The rule about unseemly conduct has been used by the Speaker to order that the rules be amended by the Parliament, without reference to the people or their representatives in the other houses of parliament. The result of this action will be that","on August 11, apparently as a result of interjections about a division taking place.

Whilst this was not immediately debated, Senator Bob Brown had asked the Acting Deputy President of the Senate to look into the matter. Later the President of the Senate ruled that the gesture was ""unseemly but not obscene"".

This ruling caused a fierce debate, with Senator Brown saying that McGauran's ""arrogant and disgusting"" actions exemplified the Government's attitude towards its new-found Senate majority, whilst Senator Ron Boswell, the National Party Senate leader, had criticised Brown of hypocrisy, stating that Brown had ""broken every law in Australia"" and ""every law in Tasmania"" (which Bartlett noted as a point of order as being hyperbole).

Senator McGauran then spoke, stating that he ""regretted his actions"". Brown however noted that this was not an unqualified apology. A motion was then put that the President's ruling be dissented from, which debate was set for another sitting. Senator Chris Evans, the Labor Senate leader and Senator Brown had called for McGauran's sacking as Chief Government whip; his National Party superiors have said that they will speak to McGauran about the incident."

Reuters reports that nine people have died from Ebola in the Republic of Congo this month. The outbreak is in the Cuvette-,"Ouest region, which is bordered by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a country currently suffering through one of the largest and most lethal Ebola outbreaks on record. The two countries are connected by the Oubangi river.
Earlier this month, the DRC reported 102 cases of Ebola, including 78 deaths, across three regions, as well as the first case to be detected outside the DRC, in Goma, a city of over a million people near the Rwanda border.

"According to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Iraq election was a blow against global terrorism. He vowed to stand by Iraq as",it recovers from the war and prepares to be free of Saddam. The elections are seen as a major blow to Al-Qaeda which had been waging an intimidation campaign in the months before the polling stations opened. The fact that people were able to go about their business on the day of the vote without being killed or kidnapped has been taken as a clear message to the insurgents that they have failed to scare Iraqis into backing away from the ballot box. The result will also be a boost for President Bush who had staked his own reputation on the war,"it moves to build a democracy and paid tribute to British military personnel who died in a plane crash on election day.

In a nationally broadcast statement, Blair said: ""It was moving and humbling for those of us lucky enough to live in a democracy and take it for granted, to see the enthusiasm and the simple determination, the clear sight of courage of millions of Iraqis that came out to vote for the first time in their lives, despite the terrorism, despite the threats, despite the dangers...Democracy in Iraq is not just good for Iraq itself. It is also a blow right to the heart of the global terrorism that threatens destruction not just in Iraq but in Britain and virtually every major country around the world.""

President Bush also spoke of the incident, saying he mourns the British and American military personnel who died on Sunday."
"Rabies is a disease that has no cure and nearly everyone it infects is dead just two weeks after the symptoms show. And yet,","there are over 20 million cases of the disease annually in Africa alone, which has killed millions since it was first discovered by the Ancient Egyptians in the year 3,000 B.C. The virus can be passed to humans through the saliva of an infected animal and if you have been infected you will die from the symptoms in as little as two weeks. The most common victims are those who are involved with working with or around wild animals. But this does not mean that you can't contract it if you don't work with them. There are many people who are attacked","last week a teenage girl named Jeanna Giese was released from a hospital having been successfuly treated. She became the first known person to recover from the disease without vaccination.

On September 12, 2004, Jeanna &amp;mdash; a 15 year old from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin&amp;mdash; was bitten by a bat while attending church. By the time she saw a doctor about fatigue and numbness, it was October 18, and the bat incident was not brought up until several days later. Usually when there is a possibility of rabies, doctors will vaccinate patients: the vaccine has a chance to act before the symptoms appear. In Jeanna's case it was too late to try to vaccinate, and her doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin devised a new treatment. Jeanna was put into a drug-induced coma for a week, and doctors began an intensive treatment to prop up her nervous system until her natural immunity recovered enough to fight the disease.

By surviving and recovering, Jeanna became the only person known in medicine to overcome rabies without a vaccine. She is not yet fully recovered: the effects of the coma are still apparent, and she has difficulty with movement. Yet the doctors believe that she is getting well much faster than they expected, and feel that Jeanna will be able to return to her high school studies, needing only physical and occupational therapy.

The novel treatment is hailed by doctors as promising, but needs analysis and verification on another human. Jeanna's is the sixth case of human recovery from a rabies infection, but the other five people were vaccinated against rabies either before infection, or before the symptoms appeared."
"Today, AOL had announced that it is launching a new VoIP service to be named TotalTalk. TotalTalk is much like Google T","alk and other free services in the market today, with some cool features of its own. The most important one being the fact that you can use this service without paying anything at all. You will have the same service on both land line as well as mobile, which will make life very easy. The only thing you would have to pay is the long distance charges if you are calling out of state or overseas. The service also has the cool feature of video calling. This would be available on high-end machines. The company says that they will offer more than 20 million minutes of free international calling each month, which","alk due to its unification of verbal conversation and instant messenger into one client. However, much like Skype, client-to-phone conversations are possible. Other features include caller ID, voice mail integration with e-mail, three-way calling, and more.

Unlike AOL's current VoIP service, TotalTalk will not require AOL membership. However, access to this service may cost upwards of $34.99 per month.

Later this week, AOL will also release its new instant messenger client, Triton. Triton will contain a softphone feature that can be used with TotalTalk."
"Margaret Pardoel, mother of the first Australian soldier to be killed in Iraq since the commencement of hostilities, has expressed anger over the","fact that she was not told about the death of her son.
Speaking at a media conference on April 17, Ms. Pardoel said she found out that her son had been killed by seeing it on television. ""I've just got back from my holiday and the first thing I saw when I went home was on the TV."" She also criticized the Prime Minister John Howard for saying he would have kept her in the dark if it was up to him, and said that she thought this was disgusting. ""If they can't tell you something then they should say 'we are","death of her only son, a father of three, who was about to return home to Australia and had been planning a career change. Mrs Pardoel and husband John were devastated by the loss of their only son.

Mrs Pardoel said she opposes the war. ""I think it's just cold-blooded murder. Look at all those young American boys that have been slaughtered,"" she said. ""I don't think this should have gone on ... He said to me one night he phoned, he said, 'Mum there's nowhere to hide here, it's just so dangerous, there's nowhere to hide'.""

Thirty-five year old Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel had been on his last flight when the C-130 Hercules he was aboard crashed north of Baghdad yesterday, killing ten personnel. He was serving with the British Royal Air Force (RAF), to which he had transferred several years ago from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), as Navigator in 47 Squadron Lyneham RAF.

Mr Pardoel had been expecting to return in July to his wife and three children in Australia, where they had recently bought a new house in Canberra.

Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, says he is saddened to hear of the man's death.

""I want his family to know, and his friends to know, that he certainly did not die in vain, that this tragic accident occurred - or this tragedy because it may not have been an accident - but this tragedy occurred on a day when 65 per cent of the people of Iraq went out and voted,"" he said."
"Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found","in the Judith River Formation in Montana. The new finding has been reported in the journal Bone. The team used high-powered X-rays to take 3D scans of the T. rex and then built a detailed, three-dimensional, computerized reconstruction of the beast's skull. They also identified the first-known example of red blood cells from a T. rex, which they say may provide clues into the evolution of bird feathers. The scientists are hopeful that this will lead to further insights into the life history and behavior of these fearsome","in a sandstone formation in Montana.

MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science.

Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. “Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.”, paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Richard A. Hengst of Purdue University said the finding ""opens the door for research into the protein structure of ancient organisms, if nothing else. While we think that nature is conservative in how things are built, this gives scientists an opportunity to observe this at the chemical and cellular level.""

Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said the discovery was ""pretty exciting stuff."" ""You are actually getting into the small-scale biology of the animal, which is something we rarely get the opportunity to look at."""
"Speaking in Texas, President Bush in a Wednesday address to the American Legislative Exchange Council in the city of Grapevine said, ""","The people who are dying and suffering in Iraq want this government to be able to make tough decisions.

Speaking in Texas, President Bush in a Wednesday address to the American Legislative Exchange Council in the city of Grapevine said, “The people who are dying and suffering in Iraq want this government to be able to make tough decisions. The people who are dying and suffering in Iraq want there to be a free press that’s able to criticize.”","The violence in recent days in Iraq is a grim reminder of the enemies we face.""

""After September the 11th, I made a commitment to the American people that the United States of America will not wait to be attacked again."" Bush said. ""We will take the fight to the enemy, and we will defend our freedom.""

There has been debate within the Administration as to how to refer to the ongoing conflict. In recent appearances, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has avoided using the word ""war"", preferring the phrase ""global struggle against violent extremism."" Bush's speech marks a return to the existing phrase ""war on terror"". In the speech he acknowledged that the struggle is against those who use terror to achieve their goals, implicitly recognising that the term ""war on terror"" may be misleading.

""Make no mistake about it, this is a war against people who profess an ideology, and they use terror as a means to achieve their objectives,"" he said.

Of the military strategy in Iraq, Bush said that coalition forces continue to hunt down terrorists, and the Iraqi security forces are being trained to take on more responsibility. ""As Iraqis stand up, Americans and coalition forces will stand down,"" Bush said. ""And we're making progress. More and more Iraqi units are more and more capable of defending themselves.""

The return of American forces to U.S. soil will be event-driven decision, he said. A timetable for withdrawal is not practical because it would give the enemy a tactical event upon which to plan.

Politically, Iraq's National Assembly is working on a constitution that members pledged to have ready by August 15. The Iraqi people would then vote on the constitution October 15. If passed, the new Iraqi government under a constitution would be elected December 15.

"The White House announced the selection of Paul Wolfowitz to head the World Bank, replacing John Wolfensohn who retires as acting president after 1","0 years. Mr. Wolfowitz will be nominated by President Bush and then has to be approved by the bank's executive board, which is scheduled to vote on a successor in early March. Mr. Wolfowitz was Deputy Defense Secretary during the Reagan Administration and served as Ambassador to Indonesia from 1986-1989. He also was the first director of policy planning at the Department of State during the Reagan Administration. In the Clinton Administration he was the Deputy National Security Adviser. Mr. Wolfowitz currently teaches international relations at Yale University and is","0 years. The switch is expected to occur sometime in June.

The choice of Wolfowitz is raising controversy in Europe and developing nations. Known as hawkish and outspoken, Wolfowitz was a pro-Iraqi war neo-conservative in his role as deputy Secretary of Defense, and a chief architect in the build up to war with Iraq. Some question whether Wolfowitz, who was criticized for brushing aside European and NATO calls for caution before the Iraq war, would use the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as tool to extend U.S. foreign policy interests.

Historically, it has been the White House’s prerogative to name the candidate because the U.S. holds a majority on the 24 member board, but board members from nations other than the U.S. are seeking their own interviews to qualify the candidate before a change is made. ""The executive directors have agreed to conduct informal meetings over the coming days with the US nominee as part of the consultative process."" the IMF said in a statement. ""Thereafter, the executive directors will meet in a formal session to select the president at which time an official announcement of the outcome will be made,"" it said. The vote is set for March 31, the same day Wolfensohn retires.

Rob Nichols, the US Treasury spokesperson, said Wolfowitz has begun scheduling meetings with board members and that, ""Our nominee… looks forward to meeting with and listening to members of the World Bank board."" Reuters reported. In the meantime, Wolfowitz has worked to assure those with concerns of him, saying he would come with an open mind and no political program."

"United States President George W. Bush's nominee for Secretary of Homeland Security, Bernard Kerik, has declined to continue through Senate confirm","ation. The decision was announced by the White House on Friday.

The announcement was made in response to a New York Times article that reported Mr. Kerik had accepted $165,000 in gifts and favors from people involved in his business and home construction deals in the years before he took office as police commissioner of the city of New York in 2000. Mr. Kerik also faced allegations that he failed to pay all required taxes on these gifts and that he lied to investigators when they asked about them.

President Bush said Mr.","ation. In a letter to President Bush, Kerik explained that the immigration status of a housekeeper and nanny, as well as nonpayment of income tax on the housekeeper were his reasons for retracting.

However, Kerik's past dealings may have been the strongest reason for his decision to withdraw from the nomination. Newsweek has uncovered that as recently as 1998, a New Jersey judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kerik following a tangled web of lawsuits relating to unpaid bills on a condominum. Newsday and the Seattle Times have reported that Kerik may have business ties to the Mob and allegations of two extramarital affairs have arisen.

In addition, his windfall profit from stock options in Taser International (i.e. ""Taser guns"") with no apparent investment, has been under heavy investigation. Kerik received a profit of more than USD $6 million after selling his stock in early November, just before an Amnesty International report critical of Taser guns was released. Kerik had joined Taser International's board shortly after resigning as New York City's police commissioner; both the NYPD and Department of Homeland Security have purchased large amounts of Taser's non-lethal electroshock weapons."
Russian researchers warn that Western Siberia has begun to thaw as a result of global warming. The frozen peat bogs in this,"region are the largest reservoirs of greenhouse gas on Earth, but they have now become sources of the very same gases that caused their release in the first place. The scientists say that if these changes continue unabated, it will be difficult to stop the process and may ultimately result in runaway warming.
Russian scientists from the Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology at Novosibirsk's Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Science (ICB RAS), who conducted the research, said that the area affected was approximately 10 million square kilometres, or around half of all","region may hold billions of tons of methane gas, which may be released into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

Sergei Kirpotin, of Tomsk State University warned New Scientist that the event is an ""ecological landslide that is probably irreversible and is undoubtedly connected to climatic warming"".

David Viner, of the University of East Anglia told The Guardian: ""When you start messing around with these natural systems, you can end up in situations where it's unstoppable"". He also warns that this event was not considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

In May, scientists from the University of Alaska found methane ""hotspots"" in eastern Siberia where the gas bubbles out from thawing permafrost bogs at a rate that prevents the surface from freezing.

The permafrost has been intact for 11,000 years and started melting 3 to 4 years ago, according to Kirpotin.

The charges are based on his role as leader of the Yugoslavian state during the Balkans conflict of 1990s.

The Court at Old Bailey in London found that Zardad pursued a reign of fear along his checkpoints and ordered summary executions and torture of innocent civilians. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment.

Zardad denied all charges throughout the trials, and claimed he had been set up by enemies in Afghanistan.

""I have never killed anybody and if anybody in the whole of Afghanistan can produce that evidence against me then I will accept that crime,"" he said.

The case is considered to be a landmark in international law. British law allows the prosecution of crimes like torture and hostage-taking in the UK even if no British citizen was involved and the incidents occurred overseas. ""There are some crimes which are so heinous, such an affront to justice, that they can be tried in any country"", Attorney-General Lord Goldsmith said.

Zardad fled to the UK in 1998 after he had fought both the Russians and the Taliban in Afghanistan's long civil war. He settled in a suburban London home and was first confronted by BBC Journalist John Simpson in 2000. Simpson's report sparked a lengthy investigation that would eventually lead to British prosecutors travelling to Afghanistan and questioning Zardad's victims.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that over 31,250 cases of cholera have been reported so far this year in nine West African countries. It has claimed 488 lives at this point. ""If we look at this year's trends, the figures are still going up in many countries,"" said John Mulangu, a senior regional advisor for the WHO. ""If cholera is not brought under control in certain regions, we will soon be talking of... 100,000 cases,"" he said. ""And hospitals and health centres will be overwhelmed. Last year we were not on this scale. The problem is getting worse,"" Mulangu said.

The UN says that the increase could also be related to the fact that due to poverty, many West Africans move around, sometimes out of the country, in order to receive higher wages for their work, and the region has been hit with heavy rains. This helps spread the disease, according to the UN.

""We are about to enter the harvest season where people will be moving around,"" said Herve Ludovic de Lys, the head of OCHA's West Africa office. ""The main goal is to halt the transmission of this disease,"" he said. ""It's not business as usual. This crisis needs a rapid response.""

Paul Kessler of UNHCR has said that kidnappings and other security problems are still common in Northern Iraq.

Returns to Iraq had been voluntary, but according to The Times around 100 rejected asylum seekers have been arrested and are now in detention.

Demonstrations have been held across the country and are expected outside the Home Office today, 26 August.

Despite the increase in the rate, Irish inflation remains very low - having hit 7% during 2000 and remaining around the 5% until the beginning of 2003. Another major factor easing any worries about the increase is Ireland's very strong GDP growth - expected to be around 5.5% this year

Oregon State University (OSU) animal researchers in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Dubois,", Idaho, Research and Development Center have found a new, more efficient and humane method to reduce the number of wild deer that spread tuberculosis to domesticated herds. The new method has been used at the USDA's National Wildlife Research Center to kill over 20,000 wild deer since 1987 without incident or complaints from the public. The results of this work appear in the most recent issue of the American Association of Zoo and Aquariums (AAZK) magazine, ""The Link,"" which was released last month.
Researchers at",", Idaho-based Sheep Experiment Station released a report on an OSU-USDA study which was initiated in 1995 after breeders asked the government to determine why some rams bought as breeding studs showed no interest in females. The researchers are working under a $2.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in hopes of developing a test which can determine the likelihood of a ram being female-oriented before it is sold as a stud.

By studying difference in the animal's brains after slaughter, the study also showed what could be a biological determiner for what makes a ram male-oriented instead of female-oriented sexually. The scientists' results showed that the anterior preoptic area of the rams' hypothalamus was 50 percent smaller in male-oriented rams as opposed to female oriented rams. A 1991 study of human brains of AIDS victims showed a similar hypothalamus size difference between gay and heterosexual men.

The sheep researchers postulate that low levels of aromatase hormones in the brain of a developing male sheep fetus may have kept the brain from fully masculinizing, leading to sexually male-oriented rams.

""This lends further support to the idea that homosexuality has biological underpinnings,"" Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology, said in an interview with the Corvallis Gazette-Times.

Professor Stormshak believes that ""understanding sexual drives and the continuum of sexual behavior could possibly help explain the scientific basis of sexual assault and put an end to assertions that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."""

Apple Computer has formally acknowledged that the screens on some of its new iPod nano units are prone to scratching and cracking. The company,"will offer a $20 replacement screen service, but only if you buy it before February 23, 2007. The problem first became publicly known last week after an online posting by a blogger who had been able to damage the screen by putting pressure on it. The issue was then raised in the company's forums and other blogs. The company says that the screen can be replaced at one of its retail stores or through the company's website. However, there is a $149 ""out-of-warranty"" repair charge and you have to prove you own","has agreed to replace units with a cracked screen free of charge.

Several customers found that the screens of their brand new iPod nano MP3 players were cracking and scratching easily. According to Tyler Hall the creator of http://www.nanoscratch.com, his iPod nano was scratched within 30 minutes of use in the pocket of his shirt. He posted his concerns to the Apple support forums, but his post was deleted. He created www.nanoscratch.com to allow other users to post comments on the iPod’s “scratchability” and post photos of scratched iPods.

""This is a real but minor issue that involved a vendor quality problem in a small number of units,"" said Apple spokesperson Tom Neumayr. Apple estimates that these issues affected less then 0.01% of the total iPod Nanos shipped.

In most individual cases Apple has been telling customers that the scratches and cracks were covered under warranty. Standard warranties on most electronic products do not normally cover cosmetic damage such as scratches or accidental damage such as cracks. Users with a cracked screen can now contact Apple for a free replacement."

A later press release on Blackwater USA's web site confirms that their privately contracted forces are on the ground in New Orleans, being used to secure petrochemical facilities and provide security services for the federal government.

Private citizens are also reported to be hiring Blackwater ""military warriors"" and bodyguards to protect them and/or their expensive homes in New Orleans, such as in the Garden District, despite the repeated mandatory evacuation orders of all civilians by local, state, and federal authorities. One publication has reported that the number of soldiers for hire could be in the hundreds, as told to them by the commander of Blackwater's operations in the city. Israeli mercenaries from the firm known as ISI were also seen guarding a gated community, and were wearing full military gear including bulletproof vests and M16 assault rifles.

Blackwater has a history of being employed by the U.S. government and by private contractors across Iraq over the last two years to protect civilian and military convoys and provide security and bodyguarding services."

The judicial review was called for under article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees freedom 'to manifest one's religion or beliefs' and which was made a part of British law in 1998. The Convention includes the right to conscientious objection and the campaigners claim that this gives them the right not to pay other people to go to war on their behalf.

Their statement to the court said: ""We want to make a positive contribution to society by paying our tax in full. We object in conscience to paying others to kill on our behalf, but current tax policy forces us to do just that.""

The courtroom had to be enlarged to make room for supporters and the judge listened to the case for three hours.

Roy Prockter, an accountant and campaign member as well as a Quaker, said that the judge told them that ""our case has no possibility of being resolved in the British courts"".

The falling cover struck the left Orbital Maneuvering System pod (situated to one side of the tail fin), damaging several thermal protection tiles. The tiles provide vital protection to the Orbiter as it makes its fiery re-entry to Earth's atmosphere.

A replacement panel was fitted in less than an hour, with the only effect being a delay in rolling back the pad's Rotating Service Structure.

This has been the only issue in the build up to today's launch, the first Shuttle flight since the Columbia Orbiter broke up during re-entry in February 2003. All crew were lost in that incident, which has been blamed on damage to a wing thermal protection system panel, caused by a block of fuel tank insulation that became detached and hit the Orbiter during the first moments of flight.

An elementary school in northern California has been testing a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag-based identification program on its 7th and 8,"th graders since last year. The RFID system was put into use at the end of the last school year, according to an Associated Press article that was reported by KSBW. The technology allows administrators to know if students have signed out for recess or are present in their classroom, as well as other applications. The technology also allows them to know where each student is at all times, which may be used in emergency situations. The technology has raised privacy concerns from parents and civil rights groups. The school says it does not share data with law enforcement or outside parties, but critics say they have","th grade students since January 18th, 2005. According to the ACLU, this is the first time that public school students in the United States have been required to wear devices that enable automatic identification. RFIDs have previously been used to track students in Japan.

RFID tags contain antennas to enable them to receive and respond to radio-frequency queries from an RFID transceiver, enabling identification of pupils when they are in the vicinity of the detectors.

Each student is required to wear an ID card on a lanyard around their neck. An RFID tag, manufactured by local Sutter corporation Incom, is attached to the card. The school has installed RFID detectors at the doors of seven classrooms as well as the bathrooms, though they claim that the bathroom units were not turned on, and subsequently been removed after complaints from parents.

While some parents have complained about the system, local high school teacher Tim Crabtree told the San Francisco Chronicle, ""It's baffling why so many people are bothered by the district being able to tell them where their kids are at,""

On the other side, the San Francisco Chronicle quotes the 13-year-old daughter of Michelle and Jeff Tatro as saying:""Look at this. I'm a grocery item. I'm a piece of meat. I'm an orange.""

In his inaugural speech","ios Boeing 737 died when it crashed near Athens after flying from Cyprus. A text message, reportedly sent from the doomed aircraft, has also been revealed as a hoax.

Greek Chief Coroner Philippos Koutsaftis stated ""Until now I have done an autopsy on six bodies and first evidence is that when they were killed they had circulation in their heart and lungs.

""That does not mean that they were conscious but that they had breath and circulation. They had circulation and heartbeat so they were alive.""

Initial reports from the Greek Defence Ministry had suggested the bodies were ""frozen solid"" at the moment of impact.

The coroner stressed that as more post mortems were carried out new evidence may come to light.

Nothing is known about the cause of the disaster beyond the fact that everyone on board the airliner was incapacitated at some point, and that emergency oxygen masks had been used. Speculation abounds, with the theory that the airliner failed to maintain pressurisation at some point being the most popular theory.

Helios has said the aircraft was maintained in line with European regulations and had also received a standard inspection before take-off.

Greek police have also arrested a man who claimed his cousin texted him from the airliner, saying the pilots were blue in the face and that they were freezing. He was brought to the district attorney where two charges were filed against him, for lying to the authorities and for spreading false information, and a trial was scheduled. The man claimed that his intention was to gain publicity.

"The growing power of the Internet is clearly reflected in the decision, announced Tuesday, for the Associated Press to begin charging newspapers and broad","casters a licensing fee to use the organization's material. The new policy will be applied only to online uses of the material, but it has been reported that the fees would be as much as 10% of the annual advertising revenue from each website using the material. The decision was reached by the 1,700-member cooperative after months of heated discussion over the issue. The decision also follows on the heels of another announcement last month by the Newspaper Association of America (NAA), which called on all media outlets to stop posting entire news articles","casters to post wire stories, photos, and other content on their online editions. The changes go into effect January 1, 2006. An advisory committee meeting will be held in the fall to ease the transition.

As the Internet draws more news consumers from traditional repositories of data, increasing numbers are demanding the stories on the Internet reflect the quick updating and coverage of a large wire network such as the Associated Press.

The rates the AP charges, known within as “assessments”, have risen by about 2.75 percent annually during the 90’s. Since the service is supposed to be not-for-profit and is owned by its customers, price increases are a tough sell.

The formula for the new calculations still has not been set, making it difficult to determine how the changes will affect what the outlets charge for their online news coverage. Currently the AP bases rates on newspaper circulation or broadcast audience with the large ones footing the major part of the bill.

The AP is creating a computer database of news paraphernalia which includes stories, photos, graphics, audio and video. It is all designed to make it easier for news rooms to create usable content."

"Susan Torres, a woman who had been on life support because she is brain-dead, gave birth to a daughter by Caesarean section","in the state of Texas. The 37 year old was taken off life support and died hours later. The new born has been left with no family as both parents were reportedly killed in a car crash. The unnamed child will be put up for adoption. In my last blog, I discussed the first two of four areas that can have a profound effect on a company's performance and financial results. This time, we'll take a closer look at the second two of these critical areas.

The mother, Susan Torres, had a stroke on May 7 when the condition of her stage four melanoma went to her brain. Doctors said her brain functions had stopped and there was no hope of recovery.

Susan's husband, Jason Torres, asked that his wife be placed on artificial life support until their unborn child had a chance to develop and the baby could survive outside the mother's womb. Mrs. Torres was 17 weeks pregnant on May 7 when she was hospitalized for her condition. The fetus was in its 27th week of development when it was delivered.

The baby reportedly ""is doing well"" and is in intensive care at the Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington County, Virginia. Mr. Torres, who quit his job to be at his wife's side, is faced with thousands in medical expenses.

Rescuers are searching for the victims of the Tans Peru airliner crash which occurred earlier this month. Emergency services rescued ,"37 people from the wreckage, but at least 10 passengers and two crew members died in the incident. The flight was on a route between Cusco and Pisco when it crashed into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the central-south region of the country.

TANS say that 41 people were killed and a further 57 injured in this, the fifth airliner crash worldwide this month. The Boeing 737-200 airliner crash-landed in heavy jungle near the city of Pucallpa, 840 kilometers (522 miles) northeast of Lima, the capital city.

Peruvian authorities have ordered an investigation and have shipped the aircraft's two flight data recorders, or ""black boxes"" to the United States for data retrieval.

Jorge Belevan said ""We've also found five more survivors and that takes the number (of survivors) to 57. Two people are still missing and there are 41 dead,"" Local authorities also said that the death toll is likely to rise due to inaccessible location of the crash site. This is the second TANS Peru plane crash in three years, following the January 2003 crash of flight 222 in the Peruvian rainforest. In that plane crash there were no survivors.

Peruvian government lawyer Marco Ochoa said that rescuers are opening the skin of the aircraft to determine whether there are more bodies trapped inside.

Survivors said that the plane was caught in a fierce storm about 10 minutes before the crash. The plane then caught fire and landed in swampland."

Some stated that it was targeting the Reichstag while others said that the pilot tried to steer away from it. He was killed in the crash. People near the scene attempted to fight the fire with hand-held extinguishers, however the aircraft was mostly destroyed by the time the emergency services arrived.

The German authorities have ruled out terrorism. Police are saying that the pilot's wife has been missing since Monday and they had suspected that he might have something to do with the disappearance. It is possible that he might have committed suicide to avoid prosecution."

The play was first staged at the São Paulo Opera in November 2018 and it will be on tour throughout 2019, starting with the cities of Maceió and São Luís. The production will then be taken to other states of the Northeast region and other regions of the country, including the state of Santa Catarina. The play tells the life of the Son of God through the eyes of his disciples and those who were around him during his three years of public life. The text was inspired by the g","), containing homosexual themes and inspired by the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Alexandre Linhares, the author, tells how the play idea was born:
:Since I was a child I loved the play Opera-Rock Jesus Christ Superstar. Even my blog is after that name. I loved all the scenes of the film and I always wanted to see the spectacle at Broadway... However, the play that is scheduled to March originated during a time where my life was in a big turmoil, and I decided to post in my blog my idea about creating a play, based in that musical.

The play is scheduled to open March, 18, as part of the Theater Festival of Curitiba."

The announcement was made at the end of his first day on a three-day tour of Iraq, which he began by meeting with British and US troops and then travelling to Basra. He told the ABC that it was important to have the Inquiry so the Government could be sure there were no other problems of this sort. He also said that Australia would continue to make available military personnel to serve in the Gulf region. ""We will do all that is asked of us,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the woman who was arrested has been released from custody. She","months and allegedly maltreated by the country's own Immigration Department.

The woman, Cornelia Rau, still insisted she was German Anna Schmidt, according to her sister Christine yesterday. ""I think it will take a long time for her to stabilise,"" she said. ""At the moment she doesn't accept that she is Cornelia and she doesn't want to see us.""

""She is still insisting her name is Anna Schmidt and that her passport is in Baxter and that she wants to return to Germany.""

Refugee advocate Pamela Curr claims Ms Rau was held in isolation for 18 to 20 hours a day in Baxter's 'Red One' isolation facility, where she was allegedly kept in simulated daylight for 24 hours a day.

Her family had only discovered her whereabouts through a refugee-initiated effort to identify the woman, authorities having failed to connect the unidentified detainee with her missing person file, held by New South Wales Police since August last year.

After her family recognised media reports of her on Thursday, and contacted the police, her photo was emailed to the Baxter compound and her identity confirmed.

The schizophrenic woman had spent six months in a Queensland prison, according to Channel Nine News, as well as at least two months in immigration detention, according to various sources. Earlier reports had her being handed over to immigration authorities over 10 months ago, with only five days spent in custody with Queensland Police.

Ms Rau is presently recuperating in hospital."
"Mo Mowlam, the former Secretary for Northern Ireland, has died at 8.10am BST (07:10 UTC)","in a London hospital, according to reports from the British Press Association and Reuters. The former minister was suffering from cancer of the kidneys. She had been ill since she underwent an operation on 23 April. She had been at home with her family when she passed away.

She was a woman of great courage and a person of extraordinary drive. She will be a hard act to follow."" The Deputy Prime Minister","in a hospice after a fall two weeks ago. She was 55.

In a statement, prime minister Tony Blair called her ""one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered. She was a natural politician, could read a situation and analyse and assess it as fast as anyone.""

Another former cabinet minister, Clare Short, said: ""She was a very beautiful young woman, she survived ill health and helped bring peace to Northern Ireland and now she's gone far too young.""

Mo Mowlam was central to the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and was popular in Britain for her straightforward approach, informality and honesty.

Ms Mowlam even received a standing ovation during prime minister Blair's speech during the 1998 Labour Party Conference.

Mo Mowlam retired from political life in 2001, but continued to make the headlines by realising her autobiography which was critical of Blair's presidential style of government.

It is thought that the fall that made her go to hospital, and then the hospice where she died, was due to a lack of balance caused by a brain tumour."

According to Hall, early ultrasound images indicated Bai Yun was pregnant with twins. However, zoo personnel became suspicious that one fetus was no longer viable after veterinarians failed to detect a heartbeat in one cub last week. Bai Yun failed to give birth to a second cub Tuesday evening. ""It is likely that the second fetus died in utero and was reabsorbed by her body,"" Hall said.

"Sami Mohammad Ali Said al-Jaaf, also known as Abu Omar al-Kurdi, accused of many bomb","ing and kidnapping operations in the northern Iraq. He was killed by security forces on 2018/11/07

Sami Mohammad Ali Said al-Jaaf (Arabic: سامي محمد علي سعيد الجعف), also known as Abu Omar al-Kurdi, is a leader of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Al-Jaaf has been accused of being involved in many bombing and kidnapping operations in northern Iraq. In","ings, has said to have been captured by US and Iraqi security forces. He was arrested on the 15th of January, but his arrest has not been revealed until now.

Al-Jaaf was said to have been a threat to security because of his ties to the militant group Zarqawi and his previous criminal record.

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palesinian President Mahmoud Abbas today declared an end to military and violent activities against each other,", the Associated Press reports. The two men issued the statement at a news conference in Cairo. ""We have reached this agreement after very difficult talks that lasted many days,"" said Mr. Abbas.
Mr. Abbas also announced that Palestinians will disband all their security forces by 10 February, while Mr. Sharon promised to remove Israeli troops from Palestinian areas. The two sides are now working on details of a peace plan proposed by US president George Bush. Mr. Bush has been criticized by both the Israelis and Palestinians for what they say is his pro-",". The two leaders made the expected announcement at a summit held at Shram el-Sheikh, Egypt, the first such meeting between the two sides in four years.

Prime Minister Sharon pledged to end military operations against Palestinians, and President Abbas similarly said that the Palestinians will likewise end ""all acts of violence against Israelis....wherever they are"". Both leaders expressed hope that the agreement will lead to long term peace in the long-running conflict. Prime Minister Sharon said that the agreement is part of the goal of ""quiet, dignified and peaceful lives for all the nations in the Middle East"". President Abbas said ""the calm that is currently prevailing in our territories signals the start of a new era, the start of a hopeful peace."" Both sides also confirmed their intent to create an independent Palestinian state. The talks became possible in the renewed optimism after the death of Yassir Arafat and the election of Abbas.

The agreement marks a profound change in Israeli-Palestinian relations, but the negotiated truce is a shaky peace. The ability of President Abbas to exert control over Palestinian militant groups is questionable, and thorny political issues remain for the Israelis if they begin to withdraw settlers from the occupied territories. There are signs that the Palestinian resistance groups are willing to participate in the cease-fire: the terrorist organisation, HAMAS released a statement in the hours before the summic stating that ""was prepared to calm down resistance raids in the event the Zionist entity reciprocated,"" referring to Sharon's pledge to stop military activities, yet shortly after the summit a spokesman for the organization said it will not be bound by the cease-fire.

The agreement includes a pledge by Israel to release 900 Palestinian prisoners, to create join committees on prisoner release and the withdrawal of troops from Palestinian territories, and cooperation with Palestinian security forces in occupied areas."

Hawi is the third prominent anti-Syrian figure to be assassinated in Lebanon, and the second this month. Rafiq Hariri was assassinated on February 14th; his death led to international pressure for Syria to end its occupation of the country, which it did.

The train crashed into the side of a nine-story apartment building located nearby a bend where it jumped the track. Relatives of those lost are arriving in Amagasaki to identify loved ones in a gymnasium where a makeshift morgue is located.

Police searching for the cause of yesterday’s disaster investigated eight offices of West Japan Railway Co on Tuesday for clues to the rail driver. Police conducting the probe said professional negligence may be involved. The train operator, who in the past received a warning for a similar incident, over-shot the stop at the previous station and had to back the train up nearly 40 m (130 feet).

It is unclear whether the inexperienced driver of the train survived, 23-year-old Ryujiro Takami with 11 months on the job.

Running late and traveling at what survivors thought was excessive speed, it is believed the train lost control at a bend in the track where 71 km/h (44 mph) was the speed limit; however, any speeds under 134 km/h (83 mph) should not have caused derailment.

The train and aircraft disaster research committee, which reports to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, began to research the disaster. The committee members revealed unofficially the physical reasons of the disaster are quite complexe A member of the committee says the speed of train was monitored and at the fifth train it was recoreded that this car had run at 108 km/h speed in a certain moment after emergency brake had worked."

The company said that it would initially open three outlets, but was confident of further growth. It also announced that it had signed a co-operation agreement with the Romanian businessman and former Minister of Economy Dan Şova. Şova owns the largest cash & carry company in Romania, Dedeman. He also owns the second biggest private bank in Romania, BCR (Banca Comercială Română). Şova is one of the most important businessmen in Romania and his family owns around 10% of all the","open in Bucharest.

The investments will be covered by both parts in equal shares. We don't work in a franchise system."" Coffeeheaven also said that they would not open stores in shopping malls, but rather in the city centre or in main pedestrian streets.

Coffeeheaven, based in Warsaw, and opening its first store in 2000, is one of the largest coffee house chains in Central Europe and its surrounds. It currently has 28 outlets in Poland, 7 in Latvia (trading under the brand name Coffee Nation) and 3 in the Czech Republic."
"The state owned telephone monopoly in Costa Rica, the Costa Rica Electricity Institute, (ICE) has called for VoIP Internet to be made","illegal. They are requesting that all ISPs and service providers be required to have a phone company license if they want to provide voice over the internet. The only legal service would then be through the state run company, which charges about $0.17/minute, or 4-12 times what you'd pay on Skype or other VOIP.
Costa Rican law states that it is illegal to make long distance calls from a mobile phone to another mobile phone, but since there is no enforcement of this law, everyone does it and pays very low prices. This new proposal by","a criminal offence. In Costa Rica it has been illegal for anyone other than ICE to offer telephone services. With a reputation for preventing any rivals from challenging its monopoly, but also for providing an efficient service, ICE has recently seen its monopoly dented with as many as 20% of calls being routed through Skype and other VoIP service providers.

On the other hand those who seek to promote the software industry in Costa Rica, which already has a dominant 78% share of the market in Central America and the Caribbean, have reacted by saying the proposal would be disastrous both to software development and the country's ability to outsource work. The ICE claims that its telephone structure is being used by VoIP service providers, which is almost certainly true given that Skype offers calls from the Internet to phones in Costa Rica for 8 US$ cents per minute."
"Irish low fares airline Ryanair has announced it is to commence service of two new routes from Shannon Airport in County Clare, Ireland. It",will offer three weekly return flights between Shannon and Belfast and also between Shannon and Faro. The Shannon-Belfast route will be the first time a scheduled flight has been available on that route since 2013. The company says it hopes the new service will boost tourism to the region. The announcement was welcomed by Minister for the Diaspora Ciaran Cannon. He said he had been lobbying the company to increase the number of routes out of the West of Ireland. “We have seen the importance of this airport as a key access point,"will now fly to Bristol, England daily and to Nantes, France three times a week. The airline will also increase the frequency of its Shannon-Frankfurt route.

Shannon airport has seen its traffic figures soar in the past year since Ryanair established a new base there. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has said he expects the new routes to bring an additional 200,000 passengers to the airport.

Despite the positive announcement of the new routes on Thursday, Ryanair's share price plunged by 10% on the same day due to the London bombings that morning. However the share price recovered substantially on Friday.

Ryanair is the world's most profitable airline, having reported record profits of €269m earlier this year, and is pursuing an aggressive expansion plan which will see it's total number of passengers jump to 70m over the next few years. At present Ryanair has 91 aircraft and 230 Boeing 737's on order."
The BBC reported on January 27 that statistics released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health showed that Coalition forces killed 60% of the,"civilian population in the first four months of the occupation. In other words, they were killing them at a faster rate than Saddam was killing them during the sanctions period. This has been going on since April of last year and yet no-one has bothered to take this into account when working out the number of people who have died under the new Iraqi government. The number is probably nearer a million than it is to half a million. The number of refugees from Iraq is also now estimated to be over two million, about three times as many as there were before the war. The situation has wors","civilians that died in the period July 2004 to January 2005.

The figures, normally available only to the Iraqi cabinet, show a total of 3,274 Iraqi civilians were killed and 12,657 wounded during the continuing conflict. These figures exclude the deaths of known insurgents.

However according to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, the BBC misunderstood the matter. According to the previous story from BBC these figures were a result of Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces military operations.

However, the Iraqi Ministry of Health explained that the published figures also include Iraqis killed by terrorists, not only those killed by Coalition forces or Iraqi security forces; and that those recorded as killed in military action included terrorists themselves, and Iraqi security forces.

The BBC recognized their error and apologized in a recent news item, and retracted the conclusions drawn by their original report:

""The BBC regrets mistakes in its published and broadcast reports yesterday,"" reported the BBC.""

The figures, based on records from Iraqi public hospitals released by the Iraqi Ministry of Health, are shown in the following table:

Shortly before the release of the figures by the BBC, US Ambassador John Negroponte had told BBC reporter John Simpson:

""My impression is that the largest amount of civilian casualties definitely is a result of these indiscriminate car bombings."""
In an address to the ongoing conference of Asian and African nations Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi offered apologies for the suffering caused by Japanese,"colonisation.
He also asked the people of South Korea to ""think back over history in a coolheaded and unemotional way, and think about the future.""
""The past cannot be altered,"" he said. ""The present can only be built through co-existence with neighbors who have their own history and their own future. The future will become better if we take this into account. This is my message.""
His statement has been welcomed by many as a first step towards a peaceful and mutually respectful future between the two countries. However, others are disappointed at","aggression in the 1930s and 40s.

""In the past, Japan, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility,"" after this Koizumi added that the Japanese people have ""feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology.""

Koizumi's apology was the first apology offered by a Japanese leader for its country's past in the presence of such a large number of government leaders from different countries."
"Commander Leroy Chiao (U.S.A.) and Flight Engineer Salizhan Sharipov (Russia), suited","up in the Russian Orlan-MK space suits, were outside the station for six hours and 10 minutes on a spacewalk to install new handrails, power cables and an experiment. The two also removed old equipment that was no longer needed. The two men had been working at a fast pace since they opened the hatch of Pirs docking compartment.

Then they went over to the Russian side of the station to remove old power and communications cables that had been replaced during previous EVAs","in Russian Orlan spacesuits, left the International Space Station on a 4.5 hour long spacewalk to install antennas for the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), inspect and photograph other exterior equipment and launched the Nanosatellite mini-satellite. This is the last scheduled walk for the Expedition 10 crew.

At 06:25 UTC, the two astronauts left the station from the Pirs DC1 docking compartment/airlock and proceeded to install the last three of six space-to-space communication antennas for the ATV's rendezvous and docking with the ISS next year.

Sharipov next deployed the foot long, 11 pound Russian Nanosatellite, tossing it into space by hand. The object of the experiment is to develop small satellite control techniques, monitor satellite
operations and develop new attitude system sensors. Russian ground crews reported good signal reception from the satellite two hours after its release.

The two astronauts next proceeded to the aft end of the Zvezda service module. A Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna and necessary cabling for the ATV was installed and the men worked their way back to the airlock.

The station maintained its attitude, despite the loss of a gyroscope earlier in the space station mission, until the end of the spacewalk. Chiao and Sharipov reported being a safe distance from the attitude adjustment thrusters. Russian ground control activated the jets and normal attitude of
the station was regained.

They returned to the airlock at 1055 UTC, completing the mission an hour earlier than scheduled.

Chiao and Sharipov arrived on the station October 16, 2004. They are scheduled to return to Earth on April 25, 2005. This marks Sharipov's second walk in space and Chiao's sixth."

The New Zealand Labour Party announced its party list admidst speculations it may call an early election. The election must be held before Sept 24,", 2017. The NZ National Party and Green Party also released their list of candidates. The NZ Green Party has been the largest minority party since the last election in 2014. The NZ Green Party will have a more important role than ever if there is another election this year. The NZ Green Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Peter Dunne has been on record to say he would vote against the Government if they proposed changes to the law that would make it more difficult to buy homes for first home buyers. This was reported by Stuff.co.nz","2005. The list ranking is often seen as a ranking of the importance for each politician to the party.

Hon. Parekura Horomia was ranked at number five, the highest ranking of any Maori MP. The Maori MPs face a strong challenge from the newly formed Maori Party. Shane Jones, the highest placed non-MP, is all but assured of a seat in the next Parliament. Steven Ching is placed at 42, and represents Labour's interest in courting the Asian vote. The Asian population has grown significantly over the past ten years within New Zealand.

The surprising absentee is Hon. George Hawkins, the Minister of Police. He has been criticised for performing poorly in the House, and it is speculated he was offered a low ranking and refused. He is likely to return to Parliament on the basis of his strong hold on the Manurewa electorate seat.

At the time, no other major political party has released its list.

New Zealand changed its electoral system to MMP in 1996, before then it used FPP. In the 2002 election, Labour won 52 seats. Labour then became government in a minority coalition. Elections are held every three years in New Zealand."
Volunteers began a 60 day bed-rest marathon on March 19 to study simulated weightlessness effects on women astronaut,"s. The project will be the first of its kind, with all previous experiments being conducted on men. The team hopes that by better understanding the female body in a micro-gravity environment they can reduce the risk of medical problems during long spaceflights. The group has been preparing for this project since last April and are now ready to begin their restful adventure. The six volunteers have been asked to refrain from strenuous physical activities and maintain a diet of about 2,300 calories a day, which is approximately what would be available during a long mission. In order to stay healthy they","s. The study, Women International Space Simulation for Exploration(WISE), is conducted at the MEDES Space Clinic in Toulouse, France.

The 12 women, selected from 1600 applicants hailing from France,Great Britain, Germany, Finland, The Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic began the study after a 20 day screening for baseline comparison data as the study progressed.

The women will conduct all activities from eating, bathing, and reading while lying in hospital beds tilted headfirst at a six degree angle. This particular position, called head-down tilt bed rest was determined from previous studies to remove the vertical load of gravity on the body, inducing changes similar to what astronauts in a genuine weightless environment experience .

Long term exposure to weightlessness creates a number of physiological and psychological problems in astronauts such as:
*Reduced capacity for physical exertion
*Muscle atrophy
*Affects of confinement and isolation
*Impaired circulatory function

A total of 24 women will participate in the study. A second group of 12 will join in September.

Three groups of eight women each will be studied over the course of the two campaigns of bed rest. One group will serve as a control, receiving no specific treatments, the second will exercise, while the third will receive nutritional supplements.

The study is designed to fill in gaps of knowledge on the differences between men and women during extended weightlessness. It also aims to develop countermeasures for reducing the debilitating effects of long spaceflights.

Participating agencies in the study include the European Space Agency, NASA, the French Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency."

"Vladimir Putin has relieved from power Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the head of the Russian navy. This comes a month after an incident","with two warships that were involved in a collision off the island of Peter the Great. The president has also replaced the navy commander-in-chief and the first deputy navy commander-in-chief. The decision was announced at a meeting of the Security Council on Friday.
Putin said he had accepted the resignation of the navy commander-in-chief and his first deputy as well as of the chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, who is also responsible for navy issues. He then signed the order to dismiss them.
The decision follows the accident between two war","where 7 Russian sailors became trapped in a submarine, and had to be rescued with help from abroad.

No reason was given for Kuroyedov's dismissal, although Admiral Eduard Baltin speculated on Moscow Radio that it may be because of the navy chief's poor health. According to Reuters, he told Ekho Moskvy: ""He has been lying in hospital for two months, he had a complicated operation.""

Admiral Kuroyedov was in charge of the navy during the Kursk disaster of 2000, in which 118 sailors died when their submarine sank. Kuroyedov is being replaced by Vladimir Masorin, who was previously serving as the Chief of staff for the Russian Navy.

In remarks Putin made about this leadership change and referring to Masorin, he said ""The recent exercises, including those I have attended, show that the navy is developing and that is certainly your merit to a large extent."" Putin also added ""at the same time, there were difficult events, tragedies, but I would like to underline once again that with all these problems, all these tragedies, the main thing is that the Navy is undergoing a revival.""

Masorin added while in a hall at the Admiralty, ""One thing is clear — to continue in the condition which we are in and do nothing is simply not possible. I have been given the task of stopping the navy shaking public opinion. I am not experiencing euphoria at being appointed head of the navy. I understand the level of responsibility on my shoulders."""
"The European Parliament will vote on Romania's Accession Treaty on April 13
The President of Romania, Traian Băs","escu, the Prime Minister, Călin Popescu-Tariceanu and Foreign Affairs Minister, Adrian Cioroianu, are in Brussels to present to European officials the last changes that were made to the text of the accession treaty. The three high representatives of the Romanian state have held talks with EU President, Jose Barosso, as well as with European Parliament President, Josep Borrell, European Commissioner, Peter Mandelson, and other European officials, Rador reports.
Rador also reported that the three Romanian state high representatives had a working","escu, met yesterday with Jonathan Scheele, the head of the European Commission's Delegation to Bucharest, as well as with several European parliamentarians (MEPs). The parties discussed Romania's accession to the EU, which is particularly important as the Accession Treaty is scheduled to be signed late this month, after being voted on by the European Parliament on April 13.

Băsescu told the delegation that European integration remains Romania's first priority at the moment, and that after negotiations were closed with the EU in December 2004, accession became a matter of internal politics rather than foreign affairs.

The MEPs talked to Băsescu about public opinion regarding EU accession in Romania, as well as the impact of accession on the rural population. Judging from recent polls, the overwhelming majority of Romania's population approve EU accession, even though this may be partly due to the fact that many of them have not been adequately informed of the costs of accession. The parliamentarians also discussed the environment and the situation in neighbouring countries, especially Moldova. Tourism was also discussed in the context of promoting Romania's image to European Union citizens.

The delegation also discussed with Băsescu a key issue in Romania's accession process: judicial reform. The Romanian President told the MEPs that Romania has taken bold steps to reform its judiciary and fight corruption. There is also progress towards forming an anti-corruption department within the Internal Ministry of Romania.

As part of Romania's foreign policy, Băsescu also said that, once a member of the European Union, Romania would act as an advocate for other Southeastern European states wishing to join the organisation, as well as seeking to attract public attention to the broader Black Sea region. Romania and Bulgariaare the most advanced countries in Southeastern Europe in terms of EU integration, and will therefore be the first countries in this region to join the 25-nation bloc."
The Romanian Government has made plans and identified its aims for the next privatisation program which will end in 2006. By the,"end of this year, it hopes to sell at least two state-owned companies - the Bucharest airport and the oil company Petrom. In the first six months of 2003 the state sold off only two state-owned companies, but hopes that the second half of the year will be more productive. The Ministry of Privatisation is also preparing an offer of state-owned land to private developers. This would include land on which there are buildings or projects underway and which have been purchased by the state from owners who were unable to finish them. The state would then lease these out to","end of next year, the government hopes to sell all of its shares in Romtelecom, Romania's largest telecommunications company, which is currently owned by Greece's OTE but which the government maintains a 47% share in. The full privatisation will occur in two phases, with some of the government's existing shares being sold on the Bucharest Stock Exchange this year, and the remainder being sold in 2006.

By 2006, the government also wants to sell its share in Postelecom, another telecommunications operator, and complete the privatisation of the Radiocomunicaţii, the national radio communications company.

The Government also wantes to begin analysis and consulting into the privatisation of Poşta Română, or Romanian Post, the full privatisation of which is set to be completed by 2009 at the latest.

Romania has embarked on a quite comprehensive program of privatisation since 2000, having privatised a part of Romtelecom, as well as full privatisations of several energy distributors and the nation's largest banks, in addition to other smaller companies. However, these privatisations are dwarfed by that of Petrom, Romania's national oil company, which was bought by Austria's OMV in 2004 and is the largest Romanian privatisation ever.

The current Liberal-Democrat governing coalition in Romania has privatisation and economic liberalism as one of its main policies, having also introduced a 16% flat tax rate for personal income and corporate profits at the start of 2005."

The Coalition of University Employees (CUE) labor union estimates that around 10,000 university workers are on strike. Other strikes related to this are occurring at UCSF Medical Center, UC Santa Cruz, and four other UC campuses around the state.

The Coalition of University Employees accuses top UC officials of ignoring the union's requests regarding the high turnover rate of researchers. CUE organizers say the university is misleading the union about the quantity of money readily available for employee salary increases.

The UC officials deny accusations that they have bargained in bad faith, saying they have offered a contract to the researchers that's similar to an approved deal.

The two are working for a private company called Prime Television and Radio (PTR), which was founded last year by three former state-owned stations that were closed down during the transition period. The station had been criticized by the new authorities for alleged pro-communist and anti-US reporting. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), which is backing the Romanian union in this campaign, believes that the two may be victims of the worsening situation in Iraq. ""We have contacted the","release of the three Romanian journalists kidnapped in Iraq in late March. The journalists wrote to the ambassador saying, ""We are convinced that the authorities in your country Iraq are doing everything possible to resolve the situation. Yet we are obliged to transmit our desire and hopes that efforts will be intensified.""

The fate of the journalists in the past few days has been quite underreported in the Romanian media, as the deadline for their killing has passed yet President Traian Băsescu said this Monday that he knows ""for certain"" the three are alive. The terrorists which kidnapped them aired a tape on Al-Jazeera, on April 23, that they would kill the journalists by April 27 if Romania does not withdraw its 860 troops from Iraq. Romania declined to withdraw the troops, and it seems the terrorists did not enforce their deadline.

Israel's Knesset has voted to approve the compensation package for Israeli settlers who will be impacted by the proposed disengagement,". The vote passed with a vote of 70-32, and was backed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. The bill would offer each Israeli family that is affected by the plan $180,000 in cash and another $50,000 in state-owned land. In addition to this, each settler will have their debt wiped out. The bill also states that those who are unable to make it on their own will be able to remain in government-owned homes at no charge. The bill does not include the Palestinians living in the West Bank","from the Gaza Strip. Eight thousand Israelis will be evacuated from the Gaza Strip and four settlements in the northern West Bank removed.

MKs voted 59&amp;ndash;40 to approve a series of measures that will compensate the settlers who face relocation under the plan, with five abstentions from Arab MKs. Prime Minister Sharon's Likud party was split, with 18 MKs voting for it and 17 against.

The $1bn plan will now go before Sharon's cabinet on Sunday, where it is expected to be passed. After that, the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip could begin this summer.

However Sharon's government faces collapse if his budget is not passed by the Knesset by the end of March. If that deadline is not met, elections will be called and the plan may well be stopped.

Samsung announced it will market DVD players capable of playing back both Sony's Blu-Ray and Toshiba's HD DVD next,"year, the company said in a statement. The player will be able to play high definition video on either discs, as well as standard definition. Samsung also plans to make an all-in-one home theater system with both technologies built in, but no other details were announced. Samsung was one of the first manufacturers to offer a combination of the two competing technologies when it began selling a $1,000 LCD television that played back both high-def video discs last year. The new product announcement is another example of Samsung's ""we like them all""","-generation optical storage formats, if the two camps refuse to compromise on a single format. Assuming development is successful, consumers could expect to see such a device on store shelves next year.

Blu-Ray and HD DVD are projected to be the successor formats for current DVDs. Samsung, while leaning towards the Blu-Ray camp, hopes it can cover both bases by distributing a player with dual-compatibility. While this means spending more in development to unify the two technologies and develop a cost-effective production method, dual compatibility may pay off for the company if the formats challenge each other as VHS and Betamax did twenty-five years ago. Despite the support for Blu-Ray, Samsung has also been supportive of a unified standard to avoid such costly competition.

HD DVD offers single layer capacity of 15GB, more than triple the size of standard single layer DVDs, and benefits from similarities with current DVDs, such as cheap production and compatibility with current DVD players. Blu-Ray can hold 23GB on its smallest single layer version, and is reported to have superior durability and interactivity over current DVD-based technology and HD-DVD. HD-DVD is currently promoted by Toshiba, NEC, Sanyo and Microsoft; while Blu-Ray's base of support is the Blu-Ray Disc Association, which is led by Blu-Ray developers Sony and Philips. It is notable that Sony and Philips, who developed the Blu-Ray format, also competed against the Toshiba-designed SuperDisc DVD standard, which is the standard that is followed today.

The first Blu-Ray and HD DVD products are expected to start appearing in mainstream markets within the next year."
"Dinamo Moscow came into agreement with FC Porto on a deal bringing two stars of Portugal's national team, Maniche and Costinha into the Russian club",". The Brazilian international will sign for four years while his countryman will have three more to go in the contract he has signed in 2001. The first player is going to earn around €7 million (over $8.3 million), the second - around €4 million (almost $5 million). The same sources reported that the clubs also reached an agreement on the terms of the transfers of Dmitry Alenichev and Roman Pavlyuchenko from Zenit St.Petersburg to the Portuguese side. However, it was announced later that the talks between the sides",". Their transfer cost was 16 and 4 million euros respectively, making this the most expensive transfer deal in Russian football. The head of Dinamo's board of directors, Alexey Fedorychev, is among the wealthiest Russian businessmen and he is responsible for making the money available to the club. Another Dinamo transfer target is the Greek footballer Seitaridis, also playing for Porto, but this deal has not yet been confirmed.

Meanwhile, in a Russian Premier League match Saturday with Amkar Perm Dinamo Moscow suffered its fourth defeat in a row 1-2, dropping to 9th place. Amkar (one of the poorest teams in Premier League) on the other hand, won the second match in a row. Despite conceding an early goal, Amkar was able to fight back, score from a penalty and secure a slender lead to win the away game.

Despite numerous signings between seasons and hiring a new coach, Oleg Romantsev, Dinamo's performance is far from the best. Last season saw them at 14th place (out of 16), barely avoiding relegation, and the start of a new season isn't promising either. It is yet to be seen, whether the new signings can help the club join the ranks of the top RPL teams, such as Lokomotiv Moscow and CSKA Moscow."
"Irish low fares airline, Ryanair, this week celebrated its 20th birthday. Having reached the milestone, the airline prompt","ly announced it will cut jobs to save money and increase profits. The company says that in a move to ""increase productivity"" it will be cutting back on crew and ground staff at airports around Europe. The announcement has been greeted with widespread outrage by trade unions and other groups who are critical of the airlines management and working conditions.
Speaking at the annual conference of the International Transport Federation (ITF), the world's largest union for transport workers, Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the ITF, said the decision was ""an attack on all airline","ly used the opportunity, as always, to sell seats; launching a massive 200,000 seat sale at 99p/99c a seat.

The airline was founded in 1985 by the Irish businessman, Dr Tony Ryan. It began its existence flying a small 15 seat aircraft between Waterford and London Gatwick with the small aim of breaking the duopoly on London-Ireland flights, held at that time by British Airways and Aer Lingus. Today however, the airline now flies to over 200 European destinations with its fleet of 84 Boeing 737's and is awaiting the arrival of a future 225 aircraft from Boeing.

The company today carries as much as 3m passengers a month (depending on the season) and has revealed it made a profit of €245m (USD$307,916,000) in the past year. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated that the airline will carry over 70m passengers annually within five years. The notoriously eccentric Mullingar man went on to tell the press ""The very fact that a Mickey Mouse Irish airline can start in a field in Waterford 20 years ago and in 20 years overtake the world's self-styled, self proclaimed favourite airline is testament to the almost unstoppable demand for low airfare travel around Europe.""

To demonstrate the huge drop in airfares over the last year, the company claimed while the price of a Ryanair seat had dropped from £99.99 in 1985 to 99p today, the price of a pint of beer had trebled and the average house price in England had increased by 500%."

Chiguiro has been captured on February 2005. A delegation of authorities from Colombia was sent to Venezuela, so he could be identified. Now, after his identification, Colombian officers expects he can be extradicted to Colombia. In Colombia, Chiguiro is expected to be judged for the alleged crimes of kidnapping and murderer of the American missionaries Sthephen Everet and Thimoty Dike in 1995.

Some Venezuelan baseball players from the Major Leagues said that kidnapping is a new situation they must learn to live with. None of them said that the risk of kidnappings would prevent their return to Venezuela.

For years, Venezuelan cattlemen near Colombian borders say that they are victims of extorsion by FARC forces. This is the first time that the Venezuelan government recognizes that the FARC is responsible by this kind of crime in Venezuela.

According to the Colombian authorities, Chiguiro is envolved with the exchange of drugs by weapons with Brazilian traffic drug dealers."
Pope John Paul II has been re-admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital with a relapse of influenza which saw him hospitalised earlier,"in the week. The 78-year-old Pope was taken ill on Friday and kept under observation at his summer residence, the Castelgandolfo. He is now back in the same private ward as last time. His illness forced the Pope to cancel a public appearance for World AIDS day, but he will be present at a service later this month. The Vatican says that the Pope will remain in the hospital over the next few days for further tests and observation. The pontiff had been suffering from the flu for three days when he was first taken to the hospital last Tuesday.","this month.

He was wheeled into Gemelli Hospital on a partially elevated stretcher, and was waving to people as he entered the clinic.

Later, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls announced that the pope had undergone a tracheotomy to assist his breathing.

The Pope's re-admittance again raises questions about how long his papacy will last. One of his close aides refused to rule out the possibility of the Pope retiring saying it was up to his ""conscience"". The Pope has recently indicated that he has no intention of retiring by saying that the call ""to guard his flock"" was ""particularly alive in him"".

In a scene repeated across much of America, each morning a group of day laborers, mostly immigrants, assemble by a 7-Eleven convenience store in the hopes of getting work.

Each day, nearly 200 people gather near the nation's capital in Herndon, Virginia; these laborers do much of the hard and dangerous work not wanted by most U.S. citizens. This daily gathering has drawn both the ire and compassion of the Herndon community. A public hearing Monday night to discuss a new plan drew an overflowing crowd to the Town Council chambers. The Commission said so many people signed up to speak at the hearing that the panel will need to convene again Tuesday night.

For years groups and businesses among the community who want to help the day laborers have been working on the issue. In a plan spearheaded by Bill Threlkeld, of the group Project Hope and Harmony, they lobbied Herndon officials to use taxpayer money to build a regulated day laborer center in an old police station at the edge of town. This they say would get the day-laborer group(s) off the street. The plan has the backing of Herndon mayor, Michael L. O'Reilly.

The plan would also combine the opening of the center with a new local ordinance that would make it a misdemeanor crime for a laborer to seek work at any location other than the official one. Opponents of the plan say the town would be aiding illegal immigrants if it established the center.

A Pew Hispanic Center survey found a 25% increase over four years in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The number now is estimated to have reached about 10.3 million. Local governments do not have the authority to enforce national immigration laws, so the town of Herndon must rely on federal officials, who show little interest in getting involved."
Helsingin Sanomat reports images circulating over the Internet that purport to show male conscripts being sexually abused and humiliated,"by fellow troops at a barracks in Raseborg. The incident has been reported to the police, according to HS. The allegations are part of the ongoing scandal surrounding sexual assaults against women by members of the Finnish Defense Forces. The latest accusation involves two 17-year-old men who told their families they were subjected to physical and sexual assaults during the first days of basic training at the Kokkola base. They have filed criminal charges with the prosecutor's office. ""We can't comment on this,"" said the Ministry of Defence on",", which turned out to be a prank. They allegedly show conscripts masked and with gas masks over genitals.

In the images, released through Internet forums, soldiers are humiliated by their officers, being forced to act like dogs with other soliders holding their leashes. The Defence Forces communications director Ossi Kervinen considers the matter unfortunate.

The images are strikingly similar to those that came out of the Abu Ghraib prison last year.

Finland has a policy of neutrality, with a requirement of conscription for all men between the ages of 18-30 for 180 to 362 days. However, they can opt to do civil service work instead, which lasts 13 months."

He was also found competent to stand trial by a federal judge in Virginia. The decision clears the way for prosecutors to present their case at his trial, which is scheduled to begin November 17. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if he is found guilty. Moussaoui has been charged in the September 11 attacks for refusing to cooperate with FBI investigators before the attacks, but the charges are unrelated to the attacks.
Prosecutors say","six charges of conspiracy laid against him for his plotting to participate in the Sept. 11 attacks. Moussaoui, who had to be restrained at one point during the trial in an Alexandria, Virginia courthouse, was polite and quiet during the day's appearance.

36-year-old Moussaoui, a French citizen, faces the death penalty or life in prison in the sentencing phase of his trial. The prosecution has also asked that Moussaoui be forced to pay restitution to the victims of the attack.

19 hijackers took control of four planes on September 11, 2001. Nearly four weeks before the attack, Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota on immigrations charges having raised the suspicions of instructors at a flight school.

"As they have done for the last four years, United States Geological Survey (USGS) scientists were measuring an approximate 100 square","-mile area in and around the Oso Landslide. The team of USGS scientists has been onsite since March 23, and will remain at the site to continue gathering data as long as it takes to better understand this unprecedented tragedy. The scientists are part of a team that is led by Dr. Dan Miller from the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory and the University of Washington. The scientists are using ground-based radar to image the subsurface of the debris avalanche. In the first two days of imaging, they detected the top","mile bulge in central Oregon near the South Sister this past August. The bulge is located 25 miles outside of the city of Bend, Ore. and three miles from the South Sister.

The results of this years survey won't be available for some weeks, but geologists have come to some conclusions based on the past four years of monitoring. The intial discovery was made by using information from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Interferometric Satellite Aperture Radar satellite. Scientists believe the bulge is rising at a rate of 1.4 inches per year and is due to a large lake of fluid (likely magma) that is 4.5 miles below the surface. They also think the fluid covers an area about one mile across and extends to a depth of 65 feet. The pooling fluid could be shifting magma or the creation of a new volcano.

Ground swells aren't an extraodinary occurrence in geology. Geologists suspect that these ground swellings occur in the Cascade Range and at other volcanoes, and the majority of them do not lead to eruptions. Using the same ESA satellite technology, geologists have seen lots of bulges in the Aleutian Islands that have not lead to eruptions."

While the jury did take 11 days to arrive at their decision, they found Kozlowski and Swartz guilty on 22 of the 23 counts. To combat the aggressive jury selection strategy undertaken by the defense, the prosecution ""basically gave the jury several credit hours worth of an MBA"", teaching them about following paper trails and detecting falsification of business records.

A World Health Organization (WHO) committee comprising of 43 African health ministers has declared a tuberculosis emergency on the,"continent, with over 1 million cases and 200,000 deaths from the disease last year.
According to WHO, Africa bears about a third of the world's TB burden, but it is home to just six percent of the global population. The region also has the fastest-growing number of people infected with HIV, which weakens immune system and makes them more vulnerable to the infection.
""We have been able to make good progress against tuberculosis. But there has been a resurgence,"" Dr. Yahaya","continent.

The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in African countries per year has quadrupled since 1990, and continues to rise. Now 540,000 people die of the disease in Africa every year.

Worldwide, TB kills two million people a year; the only deadlier disease in the world is HIV/AIDS.

Some African countries such as Tanzania and Malawi pioneered TB control strategies that were later adopted around the globe. But they were not successful - Malawi saw the number of TB cases a year rise by four times over the past 15 years. Poverty, poor health systems and HIV have been blamed by the WHO for this.

Funding is a particularly critical issue. Eight of the nine worst affected African countries reported that, for 2003, they had short-falls in the funding their TB control programmes needed. However the WHO stresses that money alone will not end the crisis - health systems must be improved, and the rate at which health professionals are lost in the region must be reduced.

Africa is the only region in the world to be experiencing an increase in TB cases - in the rest of the world, infection rates are either stable or falling."

An estimated figure released by OCHA stated that $162,266,738 would be needed to be raised to target an estimated 900,000 vulnerable people. As of June 10, donors had funded approximately 39 percent of this appeal.

The December Indian Ocean Tsunami devastated the northeastern Somali coastline, further worsening the humanitarian situation now seen in Somalia. Good seasonal rains in Somalia which have ended a four-year drought have done little to help the estimated 900,000 Somalians in need of humanitarian aid."
Minor violent incidents and claims of Lebanese sabotage marked an unsteady start today for the Israeli-Palestinian tr,"uce, which began at 0700 GMT.
Palestinians were seen on a road between two West Bank towns waving flags and holding pictures of Palestinian Authority (PA) leader Yasser Arafat as they welcomed the first hours of calm in more than three years of conflict.
""We hope this will last,"" said Abu Obeidah, one of the people who had been gathered to receive the first vehicles since the truce was announced. ""The situation has become difficult.""
At about the same time, Israel reported that two men from the northern Palestinian","uce, already threatened after militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad announced that they were not bound by the agreement.

Two Israeli motorists escaped uninjured in the West Bank today after coming under fire from Palestinian gunmen.

Elsewhere, Hamas militant Hassan Alami was found dead in the Khan Younis camp of Southern Gaza, killed while carrying out activities for the group. Although Hamas refused to be bound by the agreement signed yesterday in Sharm el-Sheik, it has promised to keep quiet at the request of Mahmoud Abbas.

Another Palestinian man is in a critical condition after being shot in the chest. The man, from the Rafah refugee camp, was shot near the Israeli settlement of Atzmona. The Israeli army, which has a garrison in Atzmona, is looking into the incident.

Meanwhile, Ramallah has accused Lebanese rebel group Hezbollah of attempting to sabotage the fragile peace agreement in the Middle East. The group, backed by Syria and Iran, are attempting to recruit Palestinian militants to engage in attacks of Israeli targets, claim Palestinian spokesmen. The charges mirror those made recently by Israel, which has long accused Hezbollah of bankrolling Palestinian violence in the region.

Hezbollah denies the charges, and claims to be honouring the ceasefire agreed yesterday. However, Palestinian officials claim to have intercepted bank records and email communications that prove that the guerilla group is recruiting militants in the West Bank. Abbas is shying away from any confrontation with the group at the moment, but has sent an envoy to Beirut to persuade Hezbollah to desist from its aggressive activities.

Despite the setbacks, Israel has begun to lift restrictions of travel and issue permits to 1000 Palestinians to work in Israel, as part of Tuesday's deal. Sharon has agreed to travel to Ramallah to continue talks toward peace in the region."

Taxes were at the top of the agenda; the debate was just hours after the National Party released their tax policy.

Don Brash said that the nuclear freeze policy of New Zealand (which bans nuclear powered US warships from its ports) and Helen Clark's criticism of the war in Iraq have both contributed to her failure to secure a free-trade pact with the United States.

Helen Clark was confident and aggressive and she often forced Don Brash into defensive explanations of National's policies."

The company says that it has identified 107 cases worldwide of ""insulation degradation,"" or corrosion, of wires used to power the implants' electronic components. In six of those cases, the insulation was found to be so badly damaged that the wires were short-circuited and caused the implant to stop working properly, according to Guidant spokesman Bill Rice. Guidant said that the problems have been reported only in the U.S. and Australia. The company is now urging all of the","a week about the devices. No patients are known to have been injured by the devices at this time. This brings the total number of defibrillator models recalled to twelve.

American manufacturing giant Proctor &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) plans to acquire Gillette Co. for US$5,"7bn, the company has announced. The takeover will make P&amp;G the largest manufacturer of personal care and household products in the world, with annual sales of over $30bn. The two companies have been competitors since 1987 when P&amp;G began marketing a line of shaving products called ""Olay"" which was directly competing with Gillette's flagship shaving brand, ""Mach 3."" The proposed takeover would be the second-largest merger of all time, behind only AOL-Time Warner. The two companies are both","7 billion in stock. The purchase plan calls for P&amp;G to swap 0.975 shares of its stock per share of Gillete Co. P&amp;G also announced a stock buyback program in which they would purchase up to US$22 billion of shares over the next 18 months. Including the stock buyback program, the merger is being financed by 60 percent stock and 40 percent cash.

P&amp;G is known for brands such as Ariel and Tide washing powder, Max Factor cosmetics, Pringles potato crisps (chips) and Hugo Boss and Lacoste perfumes.

Gillette, known for brands such as Gillette razors, Oral B dental care, and Duracell batteries, has had growing problems with the growth of private labels and price cuts demanded by large supermarkets.

After the acquisition is completed, Gillette's CEO James Kilts will be P&amp;G's vice-chairman. Kilts said that he expects that this acquisition will cause additional mergers to take place.

""I believe the consumer product industry needs to consolidate,"" said Kilts, ""we believe we can bring these companies together and create a juggernaut.""

P&amp;G and Gillette have a combined market capitalization of about $185 billion US, which will make it the largest in the sector.

The early morning announcement states that 6,000 employees will be eliminated. Most of the layoffs will result from reducing overlapping management positions and other supporting positions within the combined company.

Antitrust regulators in the US and Europe plan to review the acquisition, to determine whether the combined company will have too much power over pricing and shelf space.

P&amp;G plans to provide additional details about the merger Friday morning (East Coast time) in New York."
Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was officially placed under house arrest a day after the country's Supreme Court upheld his,"indictment on charges of kidnapping and killing. The decision by the three-judge panel to order the 87-year-old general to remain in the home of one of his lawyers, Carlos Cardoen, is seen as a last-ditch attempt to save him from spending the rest of his life in prison if found guilty of the charges against him. The court also ruled that he be released on $3 million bail, but it has yet to issue the warrant to have the former leader arrested. The decision to put him under house arrest was based on medical reports which say that","indictment of one count of murder and nine counts of kidnapping.

Court officials say the arrest order was delivered to Gen. Pinochet's home near the capital, Santiago, Wednesday. The 89-year-old retired general has been at his home recovering from a stroke he suffered in late December.

A government commission, the Rettig Commission, listed 2,095 deaths and 1,102 disappearances during his 17-year rule. In 2004 the Valech Report that was issued after interviewing an estimated 35,000 people who claimed to have been abused by the regime; 28,000 were regarded legitimate.

The crimes were allegedly committed as part of Operation Condor, a campaign of assassination and terrorization meant to suppress left-wing opposition to Pinochet's regime. The Chilean-led program soon spread to other military regimes throughout Latin America, and may have had at least tacit complicity by then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The Pinochet dictatorship ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990, gaining power after a military coup overthrew the democratically-elected socialist President Salvador Allende."

As a result, the performers smoke cannabis joints on stage, and the theatre itself is encouraging the audience to join in.

Artistic director Bernhard Glocksin says that the theatre is claiming the metaphorical ""artistic licence"", to excuse the actions of the actors and audience, which are against German law. Glocksin was quoted by Ananova as saying opera would be ""improved with a few joints and some appetising lines"", noting the production was partly an experiment, to see what they could ""get away with.""

""Artistic licence"" is at par to an ""artistic liberty"", where something is exaggerated or changed for the sake of the art itself.

"The new leader of Togo, the late president Gnassingbé Eyadéma's son, Faure Gnassingb","é, was sworn in on 7 February. In a statement to the nation he promised to be ""an efficient and firm"" leader who will ""pursue the process of reforms that has been launched."" He also announced his government would seek dialogue with all the parties concerned in order to put an end to the crisis which has lasted since the elections of 2005. The swearing-in of Mr. Gnassingbé as the third President of the Fourth Republic (1993-2005), is the result of the decision of the National Assembly taken on","é, pledged to hold ""free and transparent elections which reflect the will of the people"" as soon as possible, though he did not mention a specific timeframe, nor did he address international criticism of his ascession to power.

Togolese politics have become a subject of criticism by the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations after the death of Eyadéma late last week. Eyadéma was Africa's longest-ruling leader whose 38-year rule was marked by government-sponsored violence and the stifling of political expression.

The Constitution of Togo was amended to permit Eyadéma to retain power, to allow more than two five-year terms in office, and to lower the minimum age for a president from 45 to 35. The latter move was seen as a way to allow the succession of the presidency to Eyadéma's son, then only 35 years old.

When Eyadéma died on Saturday of a heart attack, the country's Constitution called for power to be transferred to the head of the national assembly. Instead, Faure Gnassingbé assumed power and the Constitution was amended to allow this, causing criticism from foreign commentators.

Faure Gnassingbé also promised reforms, and an open dialog with the opposition parties. However, with the opposition leader out of the country since an assassination attempt in 1992, and the presidential term not set to expire until 2008, it is not clear how much change these promises will bring in the near future."

The post became available after the previous Secretary General, Miguel Ángel Rodriguez, served for only 24 days of his term of office, before returning home to Costa Rica to face corruption charges.

Luigi R. Einaudi, the former Assistant Secretary General, is serving as Acting Secretary General until the OAS decides who will serve for the remainder of the current term of office.

Before Menchú was nominated, the Central American states had decided that the candidate should be from Central America. But the Rodriguez scandal has made it difficult for the Central American states to find another candidate they could all endorse.

Chile and Mexico have proposed their own candidate for the job.

President Oscar Berger of Guatemala agrees that Menchú should be the Central American candidate. Menchú has said that if the Central American nations are in agreement, she will happily stand as their candidate.

An indigenous Guatemalan, Menchú won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, and was also prominent in her opposition to the previous FRG government which Berger defeated.

Menchú works for the current government as Good Will Ambassador for the 1996 peace accord.

The Bush administration has pledged $350 million in aid for the relief effort. Critics have been quick to compare this to the $177 million spent every day in Iraq to conduct war in that country. In comparison, there was a $500 million pledge made recently by the government of Japan.

Independently of the government, individual Americans have been directly contributing money to aid organizations. Amazon.com placed a link for the American Red Cross, collecting more than $8 million from 100,000 people as of Friday, December 31st. 12,000 donors have donated over $1.2 million to the Red Cross through Yahoo.com.

Scores of International aid organizations are accepting donations for helping victims of the earthquake and tsunami. Many major companies including Apple Computer, Microsoft, Cisco, eBay, Google, and AOL are helping enable donations through the web."
"The investigations into the 1994 Rwandan genocide should be completed by the end of July, according to a spokesp","erson from the United Nations. The investigation has been ongoing since the massacre began in April of that year and was estimated to have killed over 800,000 Tutsis. The probe is now entering the last stage of the process which will culminate with the handing down of the first international war crime charges for the atrocity. The trial will take place at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), which was created by the UN to try those who played a role in the massacre. The court, based in Arusha, Tanzania,","erson for the traditional Gacaca courts. The courts are a form of community based justice that were set up in an attempt to deal with the nearly 100,000 people accused of war crimes.

""Work is progressing quite fast in most places across Rwanda. We are looking at finalizing the investigation phase by the end of July"", said the spokesman, Innocent Musafiri.

The courts were set up three years ago, however so far their time has been taken up with trial runs. There are 10,000 courts across the country, and they are expected to take eight years to process all accused. Regular courts would have taken up to 100 years. The judges are untrained citizens elected by their peers.

The 1994 Rwandan genocide was an eruption of ethnic conflict where Hutu militia, supported by the Hutu dominated government and encouraged by 'hate radio', attempted to ethnically cleanse the minority Tutsi. Despite numerous warnings the international community did not take serious action to prevent the atrocities, which included hacking people to death with machetes, and forcing people into buildings that were then destroyed with bulldozers. Estimates place the number killed at up to one million."
The US Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah is looking for a subcontractor to produce the anthrax bacill,"us. The company will have to meet rigorous security requirements, as it will be involved in the manufacture of one of the world's most deadly toxins. The contractor will also have to make the product without killing or mutating the organism. The company that is awarded the contract will be part of a $13 million project to improve the safety and efficiency of producing and handling the spores. Dugway says it hopes the new process will cut down on the number of personnel required to work with the material.

The Sterne strain is not thought to be harmful to humans, but the intended use of the anthrax remains unclear, worrying anti-biological weapons activists. Other recent Dugway contracts for equipment to produce unspecified biolgical agents in 3,000 litre batches are even more concerning to activists.

The contracts were uncovered by The Sunshine Project, a group opposed to biological weapons development based in Germany. The work involved seems to cast doubts on the ability of the US to live up to its commitments to the Biological Weapons Convention. The post 9/11 anthrax attack upon the U.S. used weaponized U.S. Army anthrax , most likely produced at Fort Detrick.

A Dugway spokesperson declined to specify what the biological agents would be used for."
"A month after the Cook County Board of Commissioners unanimously voted to welcome the 2006 Gay Games to Chicago, the five Republicans","on the county's Democratic-controlled Board have signed a letter criticizing the decision.
The five Republican commissioners are all out of office and ineligible to vote on the issue when it was taken up by the Board last month. The five signatories include former Republican chairman of the county's finance committee Joseph M. Birkett and former state GOP chairman Edward ""Butch"" Rice.

""I'm a pro-family kind of person and conservative on social issues. That's nothing against the gay and lesbian community, but it's nothing I want to advance as a cause celebre,"" Peraica told the Chicago Sun-Times. In the same report, Gorman said that she doesn't support ""special rights for any group.""

An anti-gay rights lobbying group, the Illinois Family Institute (IFI), says it is trying to get Democrat commissioners to also withdraw their names from the official welcome. ""There is a difference between tolerating and celebrating homosexuality,"" Peter LaBarera, a spokesman for the group said in an Associated Press interview. The IFI also expressed concern about taxpayer money being used to promote the event.

Although Gay Games spokeswoman Tracy Baim she said she was not surprised by the reversal of the five commissioners, Mike Quigley, a Democrat Cook County Commissioner said of the retraction of his colleagues, ""It's a blinding bias and animosity that is overriding human interest, job creation, economic development and the whole spirit of athletic competition."" Quigley was the sponsor of the proclamation and plans to play ice hockey in the games.

Canadian military officials are being accused of covering up the use of the deadly chemical agent Agent Orange and other defoliants during the 1950,"s and '60s in a lawsuit filed by two men who were stationed at Gagetown, N.B.
The class-action lawsuit was filed this week on behalf of more than 2,000 people who say they were exposed to toxic herbicides that were used as part of an American program called ""Operation Yellow Anvil"" between 1957 and 1984.
The U.S. used Agent Orange, which contains the cancer-causing defoliant dioxin, during the Vietnam War to remove vegetation from","s and 1960s at a New Brunswick base.

At a public meeting attended by at least 200 people, defence officials said only a small amount of the herbicide was used, over a total of seven days between 1966 and 1967 at the army base to clear foliage to prevent fires during artillery training and to clear the view for soldiers.

The American military was also given permission by the Canadian military to test Agent Orange, Agent Purple, and Agent White during the Vietnam War on less than 500 acres of the Canadian base.

Thursday’s public meeting followed in the aftermath of recent media reports that a U.S. army report indicated the use of Agent Purple, which is considered three-times more toxic than Agent Orange, as part of the spraying program.

When revelations about the use of Agent Purple first surfaced in mid-June, retired sergeant, Earl Graves, said, “They were out in the exercise area and the planes flew over spraying and they were told to just put ponchos over their head, that it wouldn’t hurt them.”

He said 170 soldiers in his regiment died of cancer and many of them died young.

At the public meeting held Thursday afternoon, angry and fearful civilians and veterans voiced fears that the chemicals were responsible for illnesses later developed.

Veteran John Chisholm said soldiers were told the sprays were harmless and to keep their mouths shut. “Now we found out this stuff here is killing us. No wonder all my buddies are dead.”

The Defence Department said Thursday that it was conducting tests to determine the dioxin level in the soil and consulting with the U.S. military to find out the exact carcinogen levels in the sprays used."
"WASHINTON D.C., USA – (Washington Post) A Washington Post report reveals a secret intelligence department created by the Pentagon ""","in response to 9/11"" has been amassing information on people's behavior for years, all without their knowledge. The program was called the 'Mind's Eye.' The project began with the best of intentions, according to documents and people involved in it. But they say that over time it grew into a rogue operation, spying on people in the US and other countries under the guise of national security.

The project was announced by President Pedro Pires at a meeting with his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva during a state visit to the African nation. ""We want the University of Cape Verde to become the reference point of this nation for education,"" said the president of Uni-CV, Jose Carlos Braga de Almeida. He also said that","

"In an interview by John D. O'Connor for the American magazine Vanity Fair, it was revealed that W. Mark Felt, a former","Deputy Director of the FBI and the infamous ""Deep Throat"" from the Watergate scandal, has identified himself as the long-suspected secret source for the Washington Post. The 91 year old Felt said he wanted to go public before his death in order to put the record straight on who had helped uncover the biggest scandal of the century. He told the magazine that he was the person who provided information to two of the paper's journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, during their investigation into the scandal which ultimately forced president Richard Nixon to resign","associate director of the FBI during the Nixon Administration, was the anonymous informer called ""Deep Throat"". ""Deep Throat"" helped journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein bring down then-president Richard Milhous Nixon through the exposure of the Watergate scandal.

Previously bound by a pledge not to reveal ""Deep Throat's"" identity until after his death, Woodward and Bernstein at first refused to confirm the Vanity Fair report. However, in a story posted late today on the Washington Post website, they verified that Felt was ""Deep Throat.""

However, one of Richard Nixon's biographers, Jonathan Aitken, believes that at least one of ""Deep Throat's"" tips could not have been known by Felt. The Post first reported on the famous 18 1/2 minute gap in a crucial tape at a time when only six people were aware of its existence -- none of them Felt. This raises the possibility that ""Deep Throat,"" though mainly based on Felt, may be a composite character.

Felt has been mentioned as a leading candidate for ""Deep Throat"" by many that have tried to solve the mystery. An article published in the American Journalism Review last fall claimed Carl Bernstein's son once exposed Felt as the mysterious informer. But until now, Felt, Woodward, Bernstein and the Post's former editor Ben Bradlee have all denied it.

Felt, 91, has reportedly been in poor health in recent years. His family says Felt admits to being the source and described him as feeling proud of his role in history and having ""a big grin"" when told of the Vanity Fair article."
An insurgency involving approximately 40 to 60 fighters at Abu Ghraib prison base was repelled by the Iraqi,"security forces (ISF), backed by US airstrikes, in early hours of Friday. The operation lasted from about 12.30 am on Friday to around 7.00 am, according to reports. The attackers are thought to be former Iraqi officers who have been released from the prison and are now holding other detainees as well. The prison has been used as a detention center since the US-led invasion in 2003. The prison is notorious for the atrocities that were committed during Saddam’s time and also during the American occupation","and US armies on Saturday, according to Lieutenant Colonel Guy Rudisill in a conversation with Reuters.

The conflict, described as intermittent and lasting an hour, involved two car bombs, rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire. Officials in Baghdad reported approximately 20 U.S. service members and 12 prison detainees were wounded. According to the Colonel the attack occurred at 10 a.m. EST.

US forces responded with heavy weapons fire and eventually brought the situation under control. There are no reports how many insurgents were wounded or killed in the battle.

CBS News reported that there was a car bomb explosion today in the city of Khan Bani Saad, located in central Iraq, killing 4 police officers and injuring 5 civilians.

"A search in Wikinews for ""Inquiry"" will return many examples of Public Inquiries conducted by governmental organizations into issues that are often","the subject of heated debate and public outcry. The most famous example of this was probably the Hutton Inquiry which investigated the death of UK scientist Dr. David Kelly, who died while being investigated over a scandal surrounding the claim that Iraq had Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs). This particular case involved accusations of a whitewash from both the families of those killed in the 2003 Iraq War and the then-British Government of Tony Blair. The resultant Hutton Inquiry found no wrongdoing on the part of the","deeply controversial.

The processes and terms of reference of such 'Public' Inquiries are normally determined by the commissioning governmental body. However the Internet has now made possible the emergence of a new type of Public Inquiry, called an ""E-Inquiry"" that appears to be not only independent of government but also, like a Wiki, enables anyone who wishes to partake in the Inquiry to do so by contributing evidence and by posing questions that contribute to the process of determining the Terms of reference of the E-Inquiry.

The absence of a US government sponsored independent public inquiry into the Katrina hurricane disaster could well be the spur that led to the development of a new non-profit web site that incorporates a framework for conducting a Public E-Inquiry. That site http://www.ForumKatrina.org carries the banner line ""Katrina Support, Recovery, Planning &amp; E-Inquiry"".

The web site owners have given permission to quote the following extract from its statement on the web site about the objective of its E-Inquiry:

""Everyone who may think of getting involved in the E-Inquiry is asked to remember, at every stage in the process, that the end purpose of the E-Inquiry is to provide recommendations, for the future. The objective of those recommendations is to help everyone to avoid death, disease and destruction in consequence of forthcoming natural and man-made disasters. If those recommendations are to be taken seriously, and this, the first E-Inquiry, is to acquire any public credibility, then the process must be democratic, patently fair and intellectually rigorous.""

It will be interesting to see whether an E-Inquiry is capable of meeting these ideals and whether they become a common feature of internet activity."
"After a year-long investigation, a committee has found that Kofi Annan, head of the United Nations, failed to halt corruption in the","$130 million oil-for-food program for Iraq. The U.S. says it will present the results to the Security Council on Friday.
Annual reports by the Iraqi Survey Group and by the CIA have been released this week. They say Saddam Hussein was able to buy supplies through the oil-for-food program from 2000 to 2003 despite international sanctions, but they offer little new information on allegations he used the money to rearm or pay insurgents.

The report emphasized that Annan knowingly allowed Saddam Hussein to continue making huge unethical profits off of the program.

While Annan acknowledged that there was blame to pass around, he stated that ""None of us -- member states, Secretariat, agencies, funds and programs -- can be proud of what it has found."" Annan also says that he was at least partly at fault for the corruption; ""The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism.""

On a lighter note, while the report is critical of Annan, it also says that the Oil for Food program did help get food to many Iraqis."

A controversial patent directive has been thrown out in a landslide vote. 648 MEPs out of 680 voted today,"to scrap the proposed software patents directive, which would have allowed the patenting of software for the first time. The decision was based on the overwhelmingly large number of amendments that were put forward by MEPs who oppose software patents. The result of this is that the proposal as it currently stands cannot be accepted and will now go back to the Council of Ministers (representing the EU's national governments).

A second explosion struck about an hour later, this time in front of the police station. The third explosion struck at the same time as the second. There has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. However, it is thought that the group Jundollah (God","that the bombings gave minor injuries to three people and caused some damage to houses. One of the blasts reportedly occurred at approximately 4:30 am, with the other two preceding shortly before.

The attack is part of a series of bombings that have occurred shortly before the Iranian presidential election. Blasts in Tehran and the southwestern city of Ahvaz on Sunday killed a total of 10 people. Despite these grave attacks, Iranian officials are asserting that the turnout for the election will not be impaired. At a Monday press conference, intelligence minister Ali Younessi said, """"The Sunday morning and evening attacks in Ahvaz and Tehran are not going to have any effect on people's presence at presidential election polls."""
"Britain's Secretary of State for Health, John Reid, is amongst those calling for the withdrawal of Conservative candidate for Dorset South, Ed","wina Currie. The issue has been aired on Radio 4 and it was reported in this week's New Statesman magazine that she said ""in private"" that the UK would be better off if there were more HIV-infected people in the country. She also told the same group of party donors that she had not voted Tory since she left Parliament in 1997.

The photo in question originally showed Matts and the Conservative front-bencher Anne Widdecombe campaigning on behalf of an immigrant family living in Weymouth, in the Dorset South constituency, in March last year.

When the photo appeared in Matts' campaign literature, the people in the background were removed from the photo and a slogan calling for the family to be allowed to stay was replaced by one calling for immigration control.

The seat, taken by Labour's Jim Knight in the 2001 general election, is one of the most fiercely contested in the country, being Labour's smallest majority.

Conservative leader Michael Howard condemned Matts' behaviour but refused to sack him. Conservative shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin, from neighbouring Dorset West, said that the message on the doctored photo was consistent with conservative policy.

"Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has dismissed the Minister of Housing, Alice Mobolaji Osomo, as part","of a shakeup in his cabinet. The sacked minister was replaced by Mr. Kashim Abubakar.
President Obasanjo also asked the Minister of Power and Steel, Dr. Babs Onu, to take over from Mr. Musiliu Obanikoro, who is now Minister of State for Defense.
Ms. Osomo had been on suspension since last year when she was indicted by a corruption probe into the $120-million National Housing Program. She had been re-assigned to the Ministry of Internal","of an on-going anti-corruption drive to clean up Nigeria's world image.

A statement from the president's office said Mr. Osomo was sacked after the sale of public property violated instructions. According to a BBC report, the Minister allocated more than 200 properties to top officials rather than going on public sale.

President Obasanjo has been vocal in tackling corruption and reportedly warned officials their greed is undermining his attempts to win international debt relief. In March, he fired Education Minister Fabian Osuji in a broadcast to the nation during which he said 14 people had been involved in fraud and accused Mr. Osuji of offering a bribe of 55 million naira (US$417,000) to senate president Adolfus Wabara in order to get a bigger budget for his ministry."
"Dr. Stephen Schoenthaler, a Professor of Criminal Justice at the California State University in Stanislaus, has long argued that there is a","very good chance that Oswald was the only person to have fired a shot from the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository on November 22, 1963. In his most recent work, he presents an overview of the many unresolved problems with the government's ""lone gunman"" story and then outlines the many problems with the alternative theories which have been proposed as substitutes. He shows that each of these theories also has unresolved problems and then goes on to present what he believes is the only reasonable and complete solution to all of the mysteries surrounding","link between a healthy diet and decreased aggressive behaviour, as well as with increased IQ and school performance.

Dr. Schoenthaler is well-known for a youth detention center study where violations of house rules fell by 37% when vending machines were removed and the cafeteria replaced canned food by fresh alternatives. He summarizes his findings by saying that “Having a bad diet right now is a better predictor of future violence than past violent behaviour.” In a very large test, Schoenthaler directed a study in meals at 803 New York City schools, in low-income neighbourhoods, finding that the number of students passing final exams increased by 16%.

Critics have questioned some of Dr. Schoenthaler findings, due to the lack of placebo control groups. However, more recent work by Dr. Bernard Gesch, a physiologist at the University of Oxford, has placed some of the work on a more scientific footing. Dr. Gesch found that nutrition supplements produced a 26% drop in violations of prison rules over a placebo, and a 37% decrease in violent offences. The Netherlands has embarked on a wider scale dietary research program in 14 prisons.

The short term behaviour consequences of ingesting sugar are well understood: an initial burst on energy, followed a sugar low in which your body produces adrenalin, which makes you irritable and explosive. However, Schoenthaler and Gesch suggest that there are long term impacts over and above the short term consequences of blood sugar variations."

The match looked to be in Englands hands following sterling batting from Kevin Pietersen (71, 20) and Andrew Flintoff (68, 73) which left the Australians needing to score 282 to win the match. The tourists were soon in trouble ending the third day at 175-8 with over 100 runs still to score and only 2 wickets in hand.

However on the fourth morning the Australian tailenders scored steadily and despite the loss of Shane Warne for 42 the final wicket pair closed in on the target.

The Edgbaston crowd were reduced to biting their nails as the match came down to the wire; Australia needing just 3 runs to win and England needing just one wicket.

Harmison produced a lifting delivery from just short of a length which Kasprovic could only fend off with a glove through to the England 'keeper Geraint Jones, leaving Australia agonisingly short of a memorable win and the series all square at one match each with three to play.

:WHEREAS, UN weapons inspectors showed prior to the invasion that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; and

:WHEREAS, there is further mounting evidence that the Administration lied or misled about ""mushroom clouds,"" ""connections to 9/11,"" and ""war as a last resort"" as they sought UN, Congressional, and public approvals;

:THEREFORE, RESOLVED, the DPW asks Congress to immediately begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush, Vice President Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.

The resolution alleges that the Bush administration ""lied or misled"" Congress and the American people concerning the justification for the war. The ""Downing Street memo"" and reports from U.N. weapons inspectors are mentioned as evidence of deception.

Newly elected state party Chairman Joe Wineke said, ""Democrats, not only in Wisconsin but throughout the U.S., have been outraged by what we believe has been a clear cover-up of why the U.S. went into Iraq,"" and that the resolution expresses ""the sense of frustration that Democrats in Wisconsin have over fighting a war for the wrong reasons.""

He said the rebels shot dead a local government official and his brother and also kidnapped a policeman in the same district.

""We don't know yet why these people were killed, they may be executed because they refused to adhere to the FNL ideology, as the area where they have been killed is an FNL stronghold.""

The Mozilla Foundation released the second major security update this week for their flagship browser Firefox. The fix patches a serious flaw in the way Firefox,"handled file downloads that could have been used to install malicious programs on a users system without them being aware of it. The issue has been present since version 3.0 and was first reported last year by Google's security team. The vulnerability was then passed onto the Mozilla team who were able to quickly come up with a solution and release an updated version of the software to all of it's users. The problem stems from the fact that when downloading a file, the file would be opened in the same process as the browser. This allows attackers to take advantage of the situation by using the browsers own features","handles animated GIF image files. Firefox browsers infected by malicious code could experience a buffer overflow, temporarily locking up or ""freezing"" a user's computer, or even executing arbitrary code which could take over a user's computer.

The flaw was discovered and reported by Internet Security Systems, Inc. The upgrade was the second major security fix in less than a month for the browser, which has grown in popularity to ten percent of the browser market in the United States.

Although there were no known exploits of the bug, Chris Hoffman, director of engineering at Mozilla, told reporters, ""because Mozilla is committed to delivering the most secure product possible, we decided to quickly issue an update to patch the bug.""

The Mozilla Foundation did not offer any details about the issue of vulnerability, but a second major security overhaul in such a short time underscores challenges faced by the nonprofit foundation as it goes head-to-head with the market leading Internet Explorer browser by Microsoft.

The new release, Firefox version 1.0.2, ""illustrates the dedication of the strong community of developers working on the product,"" according to Hoffman. ""...we’re able to turn around patches much faster than a traditional corporation,"" he added.

Earlier in the month the EU's Council of Ministers had been asked by the EU's Permanent Representatives to make a decision on the proposed new rules which are part of a drive to reform the European satellite market and to boost European competitiveness in the software industry. However, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 27 February it was announced that there were insufficient consensus to take a decision on the","Patents, members voted to restart the entire process with a new directive.

MEP Michel Rocard noted several ""inelegancies"" by the Commission in his speech against the directive, such as not taking into account any of the Parliament's substantive amendments in its recommendation to the Council. He also took the Dutch and German governments to task for ignoring their respective parliaments. The Irish Presidency's sponsorship by Microsoft was also criticised, as were the attempted ratifications at fishery Council meetings.

There was also confusion over the actual effects of the proposed directive with industry players confirming that the Council text allowed pure software patents, while the Commission claimed it would not.

"Bobby Abreu, welcome to the spotlight.

The Philadelphia Phillies star, now 31 and a two-time All-Star",", was in his fifth year of what has been a very good but not outstanding major-league career when he began this season with the first four-homer game of his life on April 20 at home against the St. Louis Cardinals. The second time it happened, three days later, it was no accident. He had become the second player to have back-to-back four-homer games since Babe Ruth. The last man to do so, Danny Cater of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1954, also went deep in each of the first two games of a",", has produced well for the Phillies over the last half a decade without the glamour of other top players. However, last night there was no denying that he was the star of the show.

And what a show it was. The first batter in the 2005 Home Run Derby, Abreu proceeded to shatter the previous record of 15 home runs in a round, belting 24, including a 517-foot moonshot that exited the stadium in right field, going through two bats in the process. This rampage came immediately after ESPN announcers Chris Berman and Joe Morgan described Comerica Park, the site of the Derby, as a difficult park to hit home runs in.

In the second round, Abreu edged past Boston's David Ortiz (who himself hit an astounding 17 homeruns in the first round) and Milwaukee's Carlos Lee to earn a spot in the finals alongside Detroit star Ivan Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who snuck into the second round with 7 dingers, swatted the most in the second round, but his home-field advantage deserted him in the finals as Abreu smashed 11 over the fences to win the Derby for his native Venezuela.

Abreu's three-round total of 41 homers broke Miguel Tejada's record of 27, set last year in Houston's Minute Maid Park."

"Blogshine Sunday, a national effort among webloggers to publicize the importance of open access to government information is scheduled to take place on March","17. The day has been endorsed by many blogs and other online fora as well as by groups that are more directly involved in promoting access to public documents. The American Association of Law Libraries (AALL), which has long been concerned with this issue, has announced that it will be holding an all-day conference on the topic at the annual meeting in Baltimore next July. The program will include presentations from lawyers who have litigated issues of public access, representatives of state and local governments who are working to increase the availability of their data, and librarians","13, 2005.

On that day, FreeCulture.org will organize web-based writers to relate their experiences and thoughts on open-access to governmental records and freely available public information. Webloggers will be encouraged to highlight the need to have public records available in electronic formats to facilitate easier searching of information and more widespread access. Another goal of Blogshine Sunday is to emphasize that open access to governmental information should be granted to everyone, unpaid reporters and bloggers as well as professional journalists.

Recently, bloggers have played an important role in shaping public opinion about issues that were initially overlooked by traditional media. Freerepublic.com blogger Harry W. MacDougald was the first to scrutinize documents that suggested that President Bush was derelict in his military service in the 1970s. CBS News reported on the documents as if they were legitimate, but MacDougald discovered that the documents used a typestyle that was not available at the time they were supposedly written. Following MacDougald’s blog posts questioning the documents, CBS said that they regretted reporting on the documents as though they were authentic. Since bloggers are generally unpaid and do not have the editorial restrictions of professional journalists, as the MacDougald example illustrates, they are sometimes better able to research and report on issues not covered by traditional media.

Blogshine Sunday is held in conjunction with Sunshine Sunday, when professional journalists and news media will publish articles and editorials on the importance of the open records. Freeculture.org was started last April by two college students in an effort to show that technology can better facilitate public affairs involvement. More information on Blogshine Sunday can be found at: BlogShine.org"
Schapelle Corby was today found guilty by an Indonesian court for the importation of 4 kilograms of marijuana to Bali,"in May 2004. She has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, which she will begin to serve on Friday.
She had faced a maximum penalty of life in prison, but it is thought that this was only ever a remote possibility, and that a lesser penalty would be more likely. The prosecution had asked for a 15-year prison sentence, while her lawyers asked for a two-year suspended sentence, or if that was unavailable, then a four-year suspended sentence.
Schapelle's family have released the following statement.
The",". She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The verdict was handed down by three judges amidst tight security at the Denpasar District Court.

The verdict was read in Indonesian and relayed to Corby via her translator. The court erupted as the outcome became clear. Her family and supporters screamed at the judge, and said that justice had not been done. ""Scheppelle is innocent!"" one supporter said.

Her lawyer reported before the verdict was handed down that she was terrified. ""She's probably the worst I've ever seen her,"" he said.

After the verdict she stopped briefly to hug her family before being loaded into a van and driven away.

Corby was arrested at Denpasar Airport last October. On her trip to Bali, she flew from Brisbane to Sydney and then changed planes. Her defense centered around the claim that Australian airport baggage handlers placed the drugs in her bodyboard bag as part of a drug smuggling ring. It was claimed that the drugs were being smuggled from Brisbane to Sydney, but for some reason were not removed before her luggage was transferred to the Indonesian flight.

After a lengthy trial that attracted much media attention in Australia, prosecutors called for the judges to hand down a life sentence.

Hundreds of supporters and friends gathered at Tugun Surf-Lifesaving Club on the Gold Coast to watch the verdict and show their support.

Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that he felt for Corby but that Australians had to trust the Indonesian justice system. ""We have to respect the justice system of other countries,"" he said.

The judge said she had until next Wednesday to appeal."

HSIN-Secret will be used as a classified and unclassified information-sharing service that allows law enforcement and other emergency personnel to access federal and state systems, including criminal history and intelligence data, from their mobile devices and desktops. The system will also include the National Crime Information Center's Interstate Phonetic Alphabet Radio Phrase, or ""10-Codes,"" which are two- or three-digit codes used in police radios for efficient communications. The new system will be","all 50 state Emergency Operations Centers as well as 18 additional state and local law enforcement sites. ""The secret network is a component of the HSIN, which is the primary conduit for DHS to share information on terrorist threats, suspicious activity and incident management with state, local, tribal and private-sector officials."" reports Government Computer News.

Development on this $350 million system by Northrop Grumman Corporation was begun in March of 2004 with basic operation achieved in just 4 months.

""The Homeland is more secure when each hometown is more secure,"" said Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge in DHS's February 24, 2004 press release that launched the program. ""Future program expansion will include the county level, communication at the classified SECRET level, and the involvement of the private sector."" it continues.

With the ""Secret"" component in place, classified information can now be disseminated to authorized individuals at all levels of government and business throughout the country almost instantly. HSIN lets most government agencies as well as many private companies doing business with the government share information on the whereabouts and suspicious activities of anyone that comes to their attention. Internal policies and the judgement of the system's users provide privacy and civil rights protections, while who can access the system is determined by DHS."
