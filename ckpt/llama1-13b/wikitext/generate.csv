 The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a,"small area to the west of Pegasus Bridge. This was an important feat as they had been loaded to maximum weight, which made take-off more difficult. In all, the two aircraft delivered 194 soldiers of the 9th (Parachute) Battalion to the landing zone. This battalion had been chosen by Brigadier Lord Lovat for its first operational parachute assault due to its good combat record during training. However, this had also led to its being known as ""Lord Lovat's Suicide Club"" within the Brigade. The other major units that took part were","landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The Tetrarchs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "

" With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel","(the ""Lady Nelson""), followed in 1860 by New South Wales. This led to a small-scale arms race as the colonial governments built up their own forces and purchased warships . The first two corvettes of the RAN , HMVS Cerberus (1869) and HMVS Nelson (1874) were constructed at Williamstown Dockyard for the colony of Victoria , with HMVS Nelson being commissioned into the RAN on its completion . HMVS Cerberus remained under the command of the colony until it was taken over",", HMCSS Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First Taranaki War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas . The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad HMVS Cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats . New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats and a corvette . The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , HMCS Protector . Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery . Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action . The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia .

" Throughout January 17 the tropical storm would again oscillate in strength , resulting in a brief downgrade by the JTWC to tropical de","pression intensity . The cyclone then re-strengthened, with the JTWC once more issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. During January 19 the cyclone underwent an extratropical transition as the circulation center of the system moved closer to the south of a subtropical ridge to its west . As the cyclone completed this extratropical transition it had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) with the system located at 0°N, 111°W . The cyclone subsequently tracked to the","pression intensity . However , an increase in deep convection resulted in its reclassification as a tropical storm at 1800 UTC that day , followed by the JMA upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on January 18 . As such , the storm received the name Yanyan . At roughly the same time , the tropical cyclone began to stall east of the Mariana Islands and curve sharply northeastward . Whilst the JTWC indicated that Yanyan peaked in strength late on January 18 with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) , the JMA considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm .

The JMA downgraded Yanyan to tropical depression at 1200 UTC on January 20 before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its low @-@ level circulation center decoupled from the primary mass of convection due to strong wind shear .

The French assault , heralded by cannon fire , caused Dokhturov 's troops to turn their attention from Gazan 's beleaguered force to face these new assailants . Although superior in numbers , Dokhturov 's column had no supporting artillery , and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size .

 Production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors . The War Office put their order on hold in a post @-@ Battle of France decision,". In any event it is quite possible that they would not have been ready until the second half of 1940, which is when the first Churchills actually were completed. The turret would have had a different arrangement than in later years and may well not have been so roomy. The engine would also have been an older version than later production Marks. The tracks would also be of an older version than later Marks. I suspect that the armor would be lighter as well. In the event the turret would be rebuilt with a new arrangement to incorporate a more effective main armament. This was","to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle . Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks , light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour , were nevertheless deployed against them ; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re @-@ evaluate the suitability of the light tank design . The pre @-@ war role of the light tank , that of reconnaissance , meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @-@ country abilities .

The forehead is wrinkled in a frown . The lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth . The cheeks are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed . The face is slightly asymmetric , which may be due to error on the part of the sculptors or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait 's subject .

" In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as Copán , whose founder K 'inich Yax K 'uk","' Mo ' (426-435) is known to have been a Teotihuacano. This was followed in 490 by a conquest of Tikal which had been under the sway of Calakmul . After the fall of Teotihuacan the Classic Maya world entered a long and complex period of change. The political center moved south to Calakmul which remained an important power until its abandonment in the late 9th century, when its place in the central lowlands was taken by Dos Pilas which also rose to power during this time. In the","' Mo ' was clearly connected with Tikal . Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal . K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' arrived in Copán in December 426 and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at Tikal . An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan . Hieroglyphic texts refer to him as "" Lord of the West "" , much like Siyah K ’ ak ’ . At the same time , in late 426 , Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries . "
" Churchill wrote an essay in September 2001 entitled On the Justice of Roosting Chickens . In it , he argued","that the United States had been harassed for years by terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda and that its own foreign policy was one of ""roasting the world with a hot iron."" The U.S. had supported Saddam Hussein when it was in his interest to do so and then condemned him as a brutal dictator once his usefulness had expired. This is why Churchill said that the World Trade Center towers were destroyed ""in a completely rational act of political warfare"" (49).

 The absence of any form of paving between the headstone rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs . Lawn paths add to the,"pastoral, almost rural ambiance. In a time when many people had no access to parks and playgrounds, these cemeteries were like public parks where people could picnic or enjoy an outing with friends. The cemeteries also became important community resources. As more families chose the new cemeteries as final resting places, they brought in professional groundskeepers. As the grounds became better cared for and more beautiful, people would often picnic at the cemeteries. This practice led to a sense of the cemeteries as sacred, not-to-be-","garden ambiance , and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain . Where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical , dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured by the Commission 's horticulturists , as is the case in Iraq . Drier areas require a different approach not only for lawns , but also to plants and styles of planting . Similarly , there are separate horticultural considerations in tropical climates . When many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area , like along the Western Front or Gallipoli peninsula , mobile teams of gardeners operate from a local base . Elsewhere , larger cemeteries have their own dedicated staff while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part @-@ time . "

" Temnospondyls ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . In living tetrapods , the main body of the vertebra is",a bony block (the centrum ) that bears two small pits where the nerves to and from the brain leave the spine. This basic form was present in temnospondyls but they also had other bones fused onto the back of the centrum that strengthened it. The ribs were also fused to the back of the centrum so that they supported the body rather than being free-hanging like the ribs in amphibians . The ribs also had small bumps (tubercles ) that allowed them to better hold on to the body . In temnospondyl,"a single piece of bone called the centrum , but in temnospondyls , this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum . Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls : stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae . In rhachitomous vertebrae , the intercentra are large and wedge @-@ shaped , and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them . Both elements support a spine @-@ like neural arch , and well @-@ developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae .

In stereospondylous vertebrae , the pleurocentra have been lost entirely , with the intercentra enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae . This weaker type of backbone indicates the stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water . "

The existence of water in the form of ice is also supported by the presence of small craters that have been named after well-known","southern lunar poles , including the crater Shackleton . At the end of this mission in July 1999 , the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth @-@ based telescopes an impact @-@ generated plume containing water vapor . The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor , and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals , or that the impact site did not contain any ice . Alternatively , it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor . "
" The era of the wooden steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line was brief , because of new , more powerful naval guns","that were being designed . In the year of 1804 , a ship named "" Le Tonnant "" (the formidable one ) had been completed in France and it had been armed with twenty - two canons of the long barreled , muzzle - loaded variety . This was an armament that would have made any wooden warship of that time obsolete . However , this French warship had been sunk before the first cannon of its' own could be fired . In the year of 1809 , the "" Dantzic "" of France had been commissioned .",". In the 1820s and 1830s , warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18- and 24 @-@ pounder guns with 32 @-@ pounders on sailing ships @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and introducing 68 @-@ pounders on steamers . Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French Général Henri @-@ Joseph Paixhans , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sinop , spelled the end of the wooden @-@ hulled warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot , which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power . "
" However , the remnant low associated with Josephine began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 . Convection around the","circulation center intensified , and by the evening , a T-numbered circulation had once again been apparent in satellite imagery. The NHC subsequently re-issued tropical cyclone warnings for Johnston Island . The convection became more well-organized through the night , with an eye feature reemerging by the next day . As the storm moved west , its outflow was enhanced by an approaching shortwave trough . This allowed the system to strengthen to the point that the JTWC reissued their first-ever TS warning at 0900 UTC on September 9 .","system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas . However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . "
 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . W,"are was also in the business of burying people. In the first year of its existence (1840-41) it buried 90 people; by the second year this had increased to 160 people and in its final year (1844-45) it had buried 400 people . This increase is due in no small part to the fact that many people chose Ware as a place of burial, since they were either unable to afford the upkeep of the grave at the churchyards of the town where they died, or did not have the connections required to","are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government .

" Her 1923 annual performance at Aeolian Hall entitled "" Recital of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice "" became a","New York music-world event. The program featured such new pieces as Ravel's ""Songs of the Sea"" (in which the French composer had taken his cue from Debussy) and Schoenberg's ""Pierrot Lunaire."" In an age in which most people would have been terrified by these two masterworks of the new music, Ivins was so enraptured that she chose to present the first U.S. recital of Pierrot Lunaire the following year. She also included such oldies as Hahn's ""L'ile ayee","historic occasion when she presented the works of George Gershwin , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert . The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time . She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold Schoenberg , Darius Milhaud , Béla Bartók , and Paul Hindemith . The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . She opened with Alexander 's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin , then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin : I 'll Build a Stairway to Paradise , Innocent Ingénue Baby , and Swanee . Gershwin played the piano for these pieces . Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann @-@ Heink , Virgil Thomson , and Paul Whiteman . Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art .

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ulls. The bones in the neck of these amphibians were so small that it is almost certain they didn't have a neck as such . The rib cage was shortened to form a paddle-shaped body (hence the term ""stereospondyls""), which allowed them to move more quickly than other amphibians through water . Stereospondyls also had an enlarged brain case . This feature may be the key to the survival of this group for over 100 million years, but its cause is not known . The first amphibians","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "
 The 15th Brigade took over the forward positions from the 7th Brigade on 17 April . Initial dispositions had the 2,"nd Rangers in reserve near the old Hindenburg support line. On the night of 19-20 April they relieved the 46th and 48th Rangers of the 1st Rangers who withdrew to a more easterly position. On the same night, the 3rd Rangers also moved up, occupying a line which was held until 11 am the following day when it was found that the enemy were too close for the defensive work to be effective.

" The rear turrets , the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle","of the side plating were sealed over. This was to protect the ammunition magazines against blast damage. This also allowed more room in the magazine for a larger ammunition stowage. This change is often cited as being due to damage suffered during the action with Scharnhorst, but that is not the case. In any event this change did not have an effect on the ability of the ship to operate. The same can be said of the changes in the arrangement of the muzzles.

 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF,"'s operational capability. This is a good time, then, to re-evaluate Australia's defence posture. In this book I have reviewed Australia's security environment in the context of its geo-strategic environment; assessed its security posture in terms of its defence resources; and made a preliminary evaluation of its future security environment. The first two of these areas are analysed in the present chapter. The final two areas will be analysed in the two that follow.

This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF 's ability to mount and sustain such operations .

The Australian government committed to improve the ADF 's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units , expanding the ADF to 57 @,@ 000 full @-@ time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3 % per year .

" During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and","the Soviet bloc , Australia would be an initial target. As such, Australia had been relying upon its own forces to defend the country until the United States could respond with its own forces to protect Australia. The first formal expression of Australia's security concerns was in a statement by then-Minister for Defence (Sir) Percy Spender in the Parliament of Australia in August 1949 . This was followed in October of that year by a public announcement of Australia's new policy of forward defence , whereby Australia would establish its own defensive positions as close to the Southeast Asia area of","Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and RAN . "
" Beginning in January 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying the Tetrarchs and their crews inside Hamilcar","gliders. The first of these took place over Dartmoor. In February a series of trials took place using Tetrarchs towing the new Horsa gliders, which had been designed as an improvement over the Hamilcar. This was followed in April by another series of trials where the Horsa was used to carry Tetrarchs and their crews to airfields near RAF Snaith. On the second attempt one Tetrarch crashed but its crew survived. The final series of trials took place over RAF Eastchurch. During the final series the Hors","gliders .

This allowed Wartensleben to concentrate the bulk of his forces against Lannes' column which had moved west of Linz. After an all day fight Lannes had been forced to fall back but this left him free to support the other two French columns who had successfully pushed the Austri","0 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and , on 11 October , the overly confident General of Division Pierre Dupont de l 'Étang attacked Klenau 's force with fewer than 8 @,@ 000 men .

In the years since then, the Church of Scientology of Germany (Kirchengemeinde) and its political arm, the IG-S (Irreligious-Sectarian Workers' Association) have been using these plans. The activities are supported by a group of companies which is wholly or partially controlled by the IG-S. This group is made up of more than 100 companies with over 1000 employees. This group also owns two magazines which have been published in large print runs for years. In this context, it is important to point out that","and regions of the world – with the long @-@ term aim of transforming German society in line with the Scientological ideal : a non @-@ pluralist society in which Scientology enjoys overriding influence . The programme sought to address Scientology 's image problems in Germany , to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as Germany 's National Socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society , with a special emphasis on manoeuvring Scientologists into key positions in industry and government . As most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in . However , according to the BfV , the strategy has not had any significant success . By 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology . According to Fifka & Sydora ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the "" Clear Germany "" programme is still being pursued . "

" The Talmud adds that the sage Reb Meir Baal HaNess , Rabbi Meir or Rabbi Meir Baal Ha","Nes (d. c. 140) was so named because his father had been a nes, an eagle.

 In the early 1990s a group of newly observant members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue,". This led to a formal break with the congregation and the formation of an orthodox shul. The new shul is named Shaare Tefilah (Gates of Prayer) after a book by R' Elyashiv that outlines the basic laws of prayer. The old name was adopted as the name of a women's organization. The two organizations work in close harmony, often using the same facilities. The rabbi is R' Mendel Bluming. The building is located in a strip mall near a major highway. There are usually three people present during weekday afternoon",", complete with a mechitza , a partition separating men and women . The "" more feminist @-@ minded "" members strongly objected to having a mechitza anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building , even if it were not in the services they attended . The latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the mechitza would have to be taken down , or those members who wanted it would have to leave . Kinberg also signed the petition . Faced with this opposition , in 1992 the Orthodox members left , renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi , creating Eugene 's second synagogue , originally called "" The Halachic Minyan "" , and in 1998 renamed "" Congregation Ahavas Torah "" .

" The belligerents then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War , in which men lived in tunnels ,","and moved up to the surface to fight over small pieces of ground. In this sense, it is more accurate to regard the conflict as a series of battles than a war.

In a single year , there were , marriages , but by the war was over , only , marriages took place.

" The Boxer Rebellion in China began in 1900 , and a number of western nations — including many European powers , the United","States , and Japan — sent forces to protect their nationals. This led to an allied invasion of Beijing . After the Chinese forces had been driven out, a small Japanese contingent remained behind as part of an allied garrison to protect foreign concessions. However, when a rebellion broke out in Wuchang (in present-day Hubei ) in October 1911, the Japanese withdrew. In December of that year, a new Chinese republic was proclaimed under Sun Yat-sen. In January 1912, a second republic was proclaimed in","States , and Japan — soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests . In June , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China . The colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower . The force dispatched was a modest one , with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria , 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector , under the command of Captain William Creswell . Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists , who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role . Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks , Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War . The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks . The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the NSW Marine Light Infantry . "

In October they were sent to Tobruk where they remained for the rest of the year. In December they were relieved by the 20th Brigade which had been part of the 7th Division .

" Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the","ensuing conflict. The two battleships had been laid down during a major shipbuilding program to strengthen the Japanese navy that was completed in 1904. However, they had been plagued with a series of mishaps throughout the years. After the outbreak of World War I , they had been relegated to second-line duties . In the years before World War II , they had been assigned to a new first line , which would be known as the Special Second Fleet ( 特専第2艦隊 , Tokusen Daini Kantai ) and","early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the IJN 's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes . A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape Engaño in late 1944 , where they decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation Kita , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 . "

 Osbert de Bayeux ( floruit 1121 to 1184 ) was a medieval English cleric and archde,"acon .  He is the first known clergyman of his name to be mentioned in England.

After the latter had been relegated by a royal appointment in 1149, Bayeux regained his former influence.  As the clergyman of York , Bayeux also took part in the Second Crusade of the year 1148.

 The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure 's voice is unable to escape ; as if it is screaming in silence,". This can also be taken to be a metaphor of a world with a false sense of security where everyone is free but actually being held in place, like the caged figure. This may also be an attempt by the artist to point out that people have been brainwashed into believing they are free when actually they are not. This can also be related to the work of another French artist named Rene Magritte who had painted a series of paintings which featured people inside of a room but unable to get out. In his series of work ""Ceci n'est pas une pipe"" (192",". Rueful later in life , Bacon said that he had "" wanted to paint the scream more than the horror . I think , if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream , it would have made the scream ... more successful "" . The work evokes memories of the Second World War . The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court , when he was held within a similar cage . Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though , and stated that he used the device so he could frame and "" really see the image – for no other reason . I know it 's been interpreted as being many other things . "" Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity . Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to Orwellian "" shouting voices ... and trembling hands ... convey [ ing ] the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation .

 Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following,"a series of battles they made small but important gains. The Australians had been sent to support the British in this attempt but instead found themselves being sent in as the attacking force. After two major offensives, which were met by well-dug in and prepared defences and devastatingly effective Turkish rifle, machine-gun and artillery fire, they suffered horrific casualties. In August the Allies withdrew. In December they abandoned the attempt altogether. The loss of so many Australians was a cause for deep mourning in Australia.

" Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge",". The first version of Three Studies for Portrait of Lucian Freud (1969) is one of the paintings to have been completed without premeditation. This initial attempt was subsequently over-painted with another composition (the present work, Tate N05401) but this second version remained in storage at the Tate until its re-emergence in the mid-1990s. In an interview published in The Burlington Magazine in 1994, Michael Peppiatt described how the two canvases had come to be exhibited side by side in",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas "" in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . "" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer .

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","that his business had been taken over by the French. In December of that year , Ware was sent to France with two staff officers and an ambulance, where they helped establish a small first-aid post near the front lines . As more workers joined this effort, they eventually started using old lorries as makeshift ambulances . This led Ware to form a formal agreement with the French Red Cross , under which his group would be allowed to work close to the lines to recover the wounded . The service was named ""L'Aide Francaise"" but better known by its initials L.A","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nevil Macready , Adjutant @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission .

" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","anamphibian-like breeding strategies. The young of many temnospondyls would have been laid as free-floating, yolky eggs that were either laid directly onto the water's surface, or into clumps of vegetation that overhung the water . After the eggs hatched, the larvae would have remained in the water until they had undergone metamorphosis and could move on to a life on land . In temnospondyls such as Eryops , which was known for its ability to remain out of the water for extended periods of time ,","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
