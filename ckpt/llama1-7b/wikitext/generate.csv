 The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a,"narrow front from Sword to Juno. They were able to advance into the German defences with their infantry, who followed on in Horsas. They were all part of 5 Airlanding Brigade. The Horsas had no engines and could be dismantled into sections that were then towed on lorries. They were built at RAF Ringway near Manchester. Horsas were the workhorses of 5 Airlanding Brigade. They were able to take off in about 350 metres (1,148 ft). A total of 111 Hors","landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . The Tetrarchs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried ; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches . "
" Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Mer","idian was designated the county seat in 1825, there were boarding houses. A large two-story structure with thirty-one rooms and two dormitories was built on the north side of Main Street. Another boarding house was erected at the northwest corner of the town square. It had sixteen rooms on two stories with an enclosed front porch . In the late 1830s , two large hotels were built . The first , known as the Tombigbee , was built at the northwest corner of the town square on land owned by James H. Lewis .","idian reached its "" Golden Age , "" several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers . The Elmira Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 . Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 . Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District .

" With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel",", HMVS Nelson. A total of seven such ships were built in Melbourne during the 19th century and all were named after the victors at Trafalgar. They were the pride of the fledgling state's fledgling navy and were the mainstay of the Colony of Victoria 's defences until the late 1860s . The ship was withdrawn from active service in 1865 . It was subsequently relegated to coastal patrol duties before being laid up in reserve in 1866 . HMVS Nelson was then purchased",", HMCSS Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First Taranaki War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas . The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad HMVS Cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats . New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats and a corvette . The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , HMCS Protector . Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery . Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action . The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia .

" NME lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album "" starts by spitting furiously "" . The publication praised Bono","'s ""pulverised rant about how his soul was lost on the battlefields of the First World War, with an infectious chorus and some stomping percussion. A ferocious start that is sure to whet the appetite of all you U2-hating sods. ""  Q also gave it 5 out of 5 and stated the track was ""an inescapable singalong from the off. It is an up-tempo number and sounds very much like an up-tempo version of the Edge's recent work on ""11 O'","'s impassioned singing and The Edge 's guitar playing , which transformed the instrument into "" something more than an endlessly abused piece of wood "" . The review commented that the "" last ten seconds are breathtakingly beautiful "" . The Rocket wrote that the song builds a "" wall of sound "" that Bono 's vocals cut through with a "" wail of desperation , as the lyrics agonize the need for personal spirituality "" . The reviewer compared the opening riff to Simple Minds ' "" Ghostdancing "" . Reviewing The Joshua Tree , Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an "" epic opener "" . The service 's Steve Huey , in a review of the song , praised its "" insistent , propulsive rhythmic drive and anthemic chorus "" , qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite . He called the song the "" perfect album @-@ opener "" , crediting the "" slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak "" . Huey also called Bono 's delivery "" passionate and grandiose "" and "" his commitment to the material unshakable "" .

A civil rights march on 30 June was attacked, killing two Catholics. In September the army were deployed in the Catholic Falls and Ardoyne districts to prevent further disturbances. The Catholic-controlled Housing Executive began demolition of houses in Catholic districts in an attempt to ease congestion. A total of 561 houses were destroyed between 1964 and 1971; another 111 were knocked down during 1972.

 San Lorenzo Colossal Head 1 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 1 ) was lying facing upwards when excavated . The er,"osion on the head and its ear were much worse than in 2015. It is thought that this could have been caused by the damage inflicted during the removal of the head from the site, in an attempt to prevent it falling into the river. It was decided that this damage had to be restored before the head was moved back into position. The work took several weeks and the head was successfully re-erected at the end of September.

Copán itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the Copán dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of Tikal .

An individual known as Ajaw K 'uk ' Mo ' ( lord K 'uk ' Mo ' ) is referred to in an early text at Tikal and may well be the same person . His tomb had Teotihuacan characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior garb of Teotihuacan .

At the same time , in late 426 , Copán founded the nearby site of Quiriguá , possibly sponsored by Tikal itself . The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose Tikal 's authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region . The interaction between these sites and Tikal was intense over the next three centuries . "

Alternatively , it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor . "
" The era of the wooden steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line was brief , because of new , more powerful naval guns",". The @-@ ships were built with thicker timber and were much larger . But their days were numbered as the 1850's began to see the construction of larger, @-@ iron hulled ships that were able to go at higher @-@ speeds . In 1862 the US @-@ Congress @-@ approved the construction of two @-@ iron ships . They were 311 ft. in @-@ length and could travel at 11.25 @-@ knots . They were known as ""ironclads"" .",". In the 1820s and 1830s , warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18- and 24 @-@ pounder guns with 32 @-@ pounders on sailing ships @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and introducing 68 @-@ pounders on steamers . Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French Général Henri @-@ Joseph Paixhans , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sinop , spelled the end of the wooden @-@ hulled warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot , which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power . "
" However , the remnant low associated with Josephine began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 . Convection around the","circulation increased in organization, and an Air Force Hurricane Hunter flight into the storm that day confirmed the development of a closed eyewall. Aircraft reports from this flight also noted an increase in forward movement as the cyclone was accelerated to 12 km/h (7.5 mph). The aircraft observed an intensity of 130 km/h (81 mph). Around this time, the hurricane moved back out into the Gulf of Mexico. After making landfall at Port Arthur, Texas on September 11 with 115 km/h (71","system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas . However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . "
 When municipal graveyards began to overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . W,"are Cemetery at Horseshoe Hill in the north-eastern part of the town was purchased from the Murrumbidgee Shire Council. A reserve on the edge of the Horseshoe Hill Quarry, owned by the State Government was purchased and this is the present Horseshoe Quarry Cemetery. In 1892 the Catholic Cemetery at Gowrie was purchased. It had previously been known as the ""Mulloon Catholic Burial Ground"". The site was enclosed in the late 1850's with the first interment","are began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in perpetuity , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government . "
" Her 1923 annual performance at Aeolian Hall entitled "" Recital of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice "" became a","best selling recording. The success of this and the follow up in 1925 was such that she was offered the use of the prestigious Royal Festival Hall to present her own music, with an all-woman orchestra. It was an innovative step which caused much comment in the music world at the time and is often considered as being the start of the all-woman orchestra movement. The success of this led to another two tours in the US in 1926.
 In 1928 she took part in an all-woman production of Offenbach's","historic occasion when she presented the works of George Gershwin , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert . The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time . She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold Schoenberg , Darius Milhaud , Béla Bartók , and Paul Hindemith . The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . She opened with Alexander 's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin , then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson , and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin : I 'll Build a Stairway to Paradise , Innocent Ingénue Baby , and Swanee . Gershwin played the piano for these pieces . Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann @-@ Heink , Virgil Thomson , and Paul Whiteman . Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art .

" Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their sk","ull roof. They were not amphibians in the true sense, and did not breathe with lungs; instead, their gills were enclosed in the head . The large number of fossil fish from this group (125 families in all ) is an indication that this was an ecologically important group. The family Dipterenidae contains some of the best-preserved fish from this group . The members of this family had small heads with very long and narrow bodies . Some were up to 3m in length. They were carnivores. They were able to survive on","ulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . "
 The 15th Brigade took over the forward positions from the 7th Brigade on 17 April . Initial dispositions had the 2,"nd and 6th Battalions in line, while the 1st and 3rd Battalions were in reserve. The 15th Brigade was under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel M. H. A. McMickan DSO (of the 1st Battalion, who would go on to be C.O. of the 11th Brigade during the battle at Gondreans on the Western Front in September 1918).

" The rear turrets , the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle","and at the stern were enclosed. A large structure was built on the centre line, between the forward and after barbette tops. It contained an eight-inch gun with two six-pounders on its flanks. A further structure was built at the stern of the ship with another six-pounder on each flank.

" The transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement , the military , the judici","ary and the administration in the hands of the king . It also retained the ability to amend the Constitution with the king's consent.  In September 1925, the King summoned the members of the cabinet and gave his final assent to the constitutional reforms that were being introduced .

 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF,"'s ability to project its power into regional and extra-regional theatres. It was, in part, this success that prompted the Defence Minister, John Moore, in September 2003, to declare the ADF had entered an era of 'reach and influence' (Moore, 2003, p. 5). Since then the ADF's strategic vision has focused on three main goals. First, it will work with the US in maintaining security in the Asia-Pacific region; second, it will build up the ability of the ADF to work","'s ability to conduct operations outside Australia . This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF 's ability to mount and sustain such operations . In response , the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments . The Australian government committed to improve the ADF 's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units , expanding the ADF to 57 @,@ 000 full @-@ time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3 % per year .

" During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and","the Communist bloc, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) would play an offensive air superiority role. It was envisaged that RAAF units would operate from forward bases in Southeast Asia against enemy aircraft attacking the region's strategic communications. Aircraft were also earmarked to protect RAAF fighter-bomber formations during their deployment against strategic targets. In this context the RAAF had two operational units at the start of 1952. The RAAF was still using its remaining Hurricane Mk Is as part of an operational fighter","Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and RAN . "
" Beginning in January 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying the Tetrarchs and their crews inside Hamilcar","gliders. In preparation for D-Day, these exercises took place on the large grassy plateaus at Ringway in north-west England. It was during this phase that the idea was hatched of making an amphibious version of the Tetrarch to land from Hamilcars. A number of Hamilcar-borne Tetrarchs were deployed from ships into the English Channel off Dover. They were successfully recovered on board ship without damage. The success of this trial gave the go-ahead to build two specialised versions, the Hurricane Mk IIIC (","gliders . These exercises were successful ; during the training by ' C ' Squadron of the Glider Pilot Regiment , which specialised in flying the Hamilcars , over 2 @,@ 800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew .

" As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the","silyl enolate. The process involves an arylboronic acid and an amine with an unreactive group on it, such as an ester. A Lewis acid (in this case, Zn(OTf)2 ) is then introduced into the mixture to form an anion complex. The reagents then undergo an anion-aromatic shift. In this process, the carbocation formed during the anion shift is attacked by an electron-donor, thus releasing an anion. In this case, the released anion is an enolate anion. The sily","pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation . In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with α @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain . Coordination of an electron donating α @-@ substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation . "

As most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in . However , according to the BfV , the strategy has not had any significant success . By 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology . According to Fifka & Sydora ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the "" Clear Germany "" programme is still being pursued . "

" The belligerents then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War , in which men lived in tunnels ,","firing artillery into no-mans land.  They were defended by machine-gun nests and barbed-wire fences .  In this kind of war, there was very little chance of an infantry charge being successful against such well defended trenches.  A German attack at the Battle of the Somme (1916) is an example of how costly this form of attack could be, with both sides losing about 25,000 men on the first day.

" The Boxer Rebellion in China began in 1900 , and a number of western nations — including many European powers , the United","States, Japan and the United Kingdom — sent military units to put it down. It was an episode that caused much soul-searching about the use of military power by Westerners against Asians. In this book, John Sack explores the complex story of this ferocious battle between East and West and unravels its long-term repercussions on both sides. He shows how the Western forces were often at the mercy of their own stereotypes. They underestimated the power and tenacity of the Boxers; the Boxers did not take into account that Westerners were r","States , and Japan — soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests . In June , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China . The colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower . The force dispatched was a modest one , with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria , 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector , under the command of Captain William Creswell . Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade reservists , who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role . Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks , Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War . The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks . The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the NSW Marine Light Infantry . "
" The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941 . During April , the 6th Division","took part in the battle of Matapan. They were subsequently deployed in the Western Desert with the 11th Brigade moving into Libya on the night of 25-26 June and taking up defensive positions at Fuka, Sollum, Sidi Azeiz and Mersa Matruh. In September , the 11th Brigade moved north from Sollum to attack the Italians at Sidi Omar. They were able to advance about 35 km before being beaten back. They were subsequently sent into reserve until late January 1942. In March",", other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece .

" The Mongols first demanded tribute from Pagan in 1271 – 72 , as part of their drive to encircle","and then attack the Khitans. They were again there in 1285 . But this was an army on its way to another battle, not an invader looking to take the land. It is said that in the course of his conquest of China in the late thirteenth century , Genghis Khan took no action against Tibetan Buddhists . In 1311 the Mongol king Ozbek sent envoys to Tibet with gifts. A Tibetan embassy travelled to Mongolia in the 1340 s . But all this was before Geng","the Song dynasty of China . When King Narathihapate refused , Emperor Kublai Khan himself sent another mission in 1273 , again demanding tribute . It too was rejected .

Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the Mongol Army in 1277 – 78 . After a brief lull , Kublai Khan in 1281 turned his attention to Southeast Asia , demanding tribute from Pagan , the Khmer Empire , Đại Việt and Champa . When the Burmese king again refused , the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma .

 The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure 's voice is unable to escape ; as if it is screaming in silence,", while being contained. The use of the word ""cage"" could be an allusion to the story ""The Metamorphosis"" by Franz Kafka (1883 -1924). A story about Gregor Samsa, an ordinary young man, who wakes up to find himself transformed into an insect-like creature with compound eyes and six legs. It was this story that gave the English language the word ""kafkaesque"". The idea that this character is contained or contained in his own story could also be alluded to here. The story was published in 191",". Rueful later in life , Bacon said that he had "" wanted to paint the scream more than the horror . I think , if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream , it would have made the scream ... more successful "" . The work evokes memories of the Second World War . The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court , when he was held within a similar cage .

 A number of merchant ships had gathered at Bombay in the spring of 1797 in preparation for the trip to Macau to load,"with cargo.

Monument 3 was located a few metres to the east of Monument 2 , but was moved to the Parque @-@ Museo La Venta in Villahermosa . Like the other La Venta heads , its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weathering , making analysis difficult . It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion . Straps descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument . The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps ; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region . Although most of the facial detail is lost , the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident , a feature that is common to the frowning expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads . "
 Archaeological investigation of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to,"form the main shape, with small handheld chisels. They were then carved into final form with large hammers and copper-bladed drills. A process known as flint-knapping was also used. The heads were carved in sections from larger, rounded, uncarved heads, with each section being fitted back on with mortar made of water, sand, lime, and plaster. The heads were painted in the style known as Mocha-jato. The heads were often mounted on steles (standing stone monuments). The heads were associated with the rulers and","chip away both large and small flakes of stone . The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones , which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed . "

 Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following,"this up with an army landed on the European mainland in April. They were beaten off from both sites, with terrible casualties on all sides. The Turkish defences had been built with German money and were formidable. In August the Allies attempted another amphibious lodgement in the Dardanelles. It was again beaten off and this time with such high losses that it was decided not to risk another attack.

" Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge",". The final form was decided during the process of painting, with chance events such as brushstrokes or splashes of paint taking on an unanticipated and critical importance. In this case, it is not known how much the final shape was decided before the start, how much during the process, and how much at the end. It could have been all three. The important point is that chance had an essential part to play, and this was true in both the preparatory process and in the final work.
 It was this ability to use chance which allowed him to continue making art into the late years of his",". This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas "" in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . "" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that "" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . "" This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .

" On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tinto Company , found","himself with an increasing number of English and German nationals interned on the French Atlantic island of Martinique. They were there under the French policy of internment without trial, and their plight aroused his compassion. The prisoners included members of both the Royal Flying Corps and the German army, as well as civilian families. Some were being held on the pretext that they had no proper travel documents; others were there on the flimsy accusation of espionage. All were desperate to go home. Ware decided that it was up to him to take action. He took the case to the French","that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tinto chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose .

" Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through","anamorphic (non-mammalian) reproductive strategies. Members of the Dissorophoidea were able to give birth to live young and their fossil embryos have been discovered with both heads and tails, indicating that these temnospondyls gave birth to young with both head and tail present . In this group the hind limbs were large, with five or six toes on the hand and three on the foot, while in the Cochleosauridae there was a tetrapod-like arrangement, with two large, three-toed forel","external fertilization . Like most living frogs , female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . "
