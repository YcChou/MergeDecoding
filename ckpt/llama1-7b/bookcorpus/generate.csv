the war and the princess the black sand was course and hard and crunched when i walked on it .the wind picked up and blew fier,"cely in my face as i looked around me at the cold snow that surrounded me ,a howling sound came from a distance.i turned to look behind me but there was nothing there just more of the same snow covered ground . i kept on walking for what seemed like hours then i saw something moving in the distance .it looked like a bear so i quickly raised my rifle to take a shot .suddenly i realised it was not a bear it was a girl she had long blond hair that flowed down her back .her skin was fair and smooth .she looked up at me with deep brown eyes .","cely down from the mountains .i pulled my jacket collar up around my neck .wait !i looked down and found myself wearing black pants , a gray shirt , and a black jacket .had i been wearing that before ?i checked my pockets .the strange faceless clock was still there .maybe i had been wearing that the whole time .the black beach ended ."
"soon all three of us were surrounded by it , a thick vapor , a warm fog that seemed to breathe .i felt as if i was",in the presence of god and his angels .it was like nothing i ever felt before.we had come to this mountain for healing but what we found was so much more than healing .the power of nature is something you have to see with your own eyes .you will never be the same again .we are on our way home now .thank you mother earth for showing me how small i really am .how insignificant my life is in your great big world .and how important my place is here .we are only visitors .but i know one day i will return .to rest .i can not wait,"surrounded by something living , and i realized that the room was growing darker , lights straining to retain their brilliance beneath the weight of the fog that just seemed to grow thicker and thicker .the lights flickered .off and then on again , and i saw it .a hunched figure in the corner behind marcus , eyes still shining a putrid yellow .he was barely discernible through the fog , but his focus was unwavering as he watched his foster brother .i couldnt say that he was more animal than man in that moment .id never seen an animal whose bones stretched the confines of their skin , or whose limbs seemed disjointed , as if they were used to be bigger , used to being more .no , i couldnt say he was an animal .that would have been too tame a word for the thing that was carefully stalking the two men in the room with me ."

i will .the lightning was right above us .ramonia ran through the camp towards a small pass between two mountains .i kept up the best i,could and it took me about 25 min to reach her .we made our way over to a cliff on the left of the pass that went down to a little canyon with a spring in it.it had been a dry year so there was only about an inch of water in it but we both drank all we wanted .there were many springs like this around .then i looked for some berries to eat .they had eaten most of them already .there was one place they had not found any .a pine tree at the back of a rock outcrop .so i started picking,could but stole glances at the tents to see what was happening .the army formed into a line .there were about fifty people in all .i looked up to the mountain they were facing and my heart dropped .there were so many people wearing blue running down the mountain that it looked like a tsunami coming to destroy everything .i ran a little faster .ramonia turned up the side of the mountain on the right .

i like how this chapter turned out i had no idea what would happen in the end of it all but it came together quite well . i do wish we could have seen more of her though . i wanted to know her thoughts as she went on with her day . i really enjoyed writing her part of it and hope you did too. i look forward to your response . i love your work . i can see why your story was a winner . i am happy for you . i will be waiting for your next story . take your time with it . i","ase the last trace of the creature .then he leads her , broken and sobbing , after him into the light .when they are safe , he works on pulling the piece of her back together .he starts from her soul and works his way up .brick by brick , holding her together with his will alone when she would have fallen apart .his mind stretching for miles in every direction just to bring the parts of her that had wandered too far away back home where they belonged .to him it takes forever to rebuild her , but in actuality , the process only lasts a minute or two .he doesnt have to work nearly as long or as hard to make himself solid once again .if using his power was like breathing , stepping back into reality was like holding his ."

she ignored it .instead she thought about trying to charm the wardens .it might make them easier to deal with .she let her face relax,"as much as it would ,the only way to do that was to not be in control of her expression and just let her features fall where they would.she looked around at the guards who had surrounded her .there was one on either side .one behind .another in front .her arms were handcuffed together in front of her .a rope of some sort had been placed over her head .and there was another rope which went from her feet up to a pole .there was no way for her to run away .no way to use any of her abilities to help her out .but then again ,that","into a smile .maam , the young warden said , bowing slightly .i am warden mason iris , of the virtuous order of the wardens of aendavar .he tilted his head at the older warden , the one with dark hair who looked inexplicably angry .this is warden jack penrose .how do you do , amira said .she wondered if warden iris recognized her from the summer ball , but he gave no indication one way or the other ."

"if he could perfect the use of the huntsmens device , then they would no longer have to worry about how they would get the weres they",needed and that was one of his jobs in life . he wanted to be a full fledged warden for his people not some side job like this but it would help him learn things he never had to do as a child so that one day he would be ready to take over from his parents . he knew his mother wanted him to be her successor and she wanted his sisters too . his mother wanted all his sisters to be full fledged wardens just like their mother . his mother wanted his sisters to be more than what his mother ever was . his mother wanted his sisters to be better than his mother . his,"captured to cooperate with their demands .apparently weres were big on sound .it was how they communicated with one another , and in the case of the alphas , how they gave their will , or power , physical manifestation .elijah had heard stories in which a group of alphas could howl for a star and bring it crashing down from the heavens .according to legend , they could sing the sun to sleep , the dead to rise , the oceans to walk like giants , and storms to rage across the lands .he wasnt sure how much of the stories he actually believed , but figured that there must at least be a smidgen of truth to them .especially considering the amount of funding the division had received in order to capture the alphas of briarcliff .obviously the stories must not have been completely true if his superiors really believed that bulletproof glass was going to hold the infamous gabriel evans .but elijah supposed thats where the device came in .when the facility was locked down at night , it was set to play random notes if any of the weres stepped from their cells ."
